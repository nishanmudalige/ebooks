\eoce{\qt{Scores on the GRE, Part I\label{GRE}} A college senior who took the Graduate Record Examination exam scored 620 on the Verbal Reasoning section and 670 on the Quantitative Reasoning section. The mean score for Verbal Reasoning section was 462 with a standard deviation of 119, and the mean score for the Quantitative Reasoning was 584 with a standard deviation of 151. Suppose that both distributions are nearly normal.

\item Find her percentile scores for the two exams.

\eoce{\qt{Triathlon times, Part I} \label{triathlon} In triathlons, it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups. Friends Leo and Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon, where Leo competed in the \textit{Men, Ages 30 - 34} group while Mary competed in the \textit{Women, Ages 25 - 29} group. Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds), while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds). Obviously Leo finished faster, but they are curious about how they did within their respective groups. Can you help them?
Here is some information on the performance of their groups:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item The finishing times of the \textit{Men, Ages 30 - 34} group has a mean of 4313 seconds with a standard deviation of 583 seconds.
\item The finishing times of the \textit{Women, Ages 25 - 29} group has a mean of 5261 seconds with a standard deviation of 807 seconds.
\item The distributions of finishing times for both groups are approximately Normal.
\end{itemize}
Remember: a better performance corresponds to a faster finish.

\item Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.
\item What are the Z scores for Leo's and Mary's finishing times? What do these Z scores tell you?
\item Did Leo or Mary rank better in their respective groups? Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Darts} Calculate the following probabilities and indicate which probability distribution model is appropriate in each case. A very good darts player can hit the bullseye (red circle in the center of the dart board) 65\% of the time. What is the probability that he
\begin{parts}
\item hits the bullseye for the $10^{th}$ time on the $15^{th}$ try?
\item hits the bullseye 10 times in 15 tries?
\item hits the first bullseye on the third try?

\eoce{\qt{Sampling at school} For a sociology class project you are asked to conduct a survey on 20 students at your school. You decide to stand outside of your dorm's cafeteria and conduct the survey on a random sample of 20 students leaving the cafeteria after dinner one evening. Your dorm is comprised of 45\% males and 55\% females.
\begin{parts}
\item Which probability model is most appropriate for calculating the probability that the $4^{th}$ person you survey is the $2^{nd}$ female? Explain.
\item Compute the probability from part (a).
\item The three possible scenarios that lead to $4^{th}$ person you survey being the $2^{nd}$ female are
\[ \{M, M, F, F\}, \{M, F, M, F\}, \{F, M, M, F\} \]
One common feature among these scenarios is that the last trial is always female. In the first three trials there are 2 males and 1 female. Use the binomial coefficient to confirm that there are 3 ways of ordering 2 males and 1 female. 
\item Use the findings presented in part (c) to explain why the formula for the coefficient for the negative binomial is ${n-1 \choose k-1}$ while the formula for the binomial coefficient is ${n \choose k}$.

\eoce{\qt{Serving in volleyball} A not-so-skilled volleyball player has a 15\% chance of making the serve, which involves hitting the ball so it passes over the net on a trajectory such that it will land in the opposing team's court. Suppose that her serves are independent of each other.
\begin{parts}
\item What is the probability that on the $10^{th}$ try she will make her $3^{rd}$ successful serve?
\item Suppose she has made two successful serves in nine attempts. What is the probability that her $10^{th}$ serve will be successful?
\item Even though parts (a) and (b) discuss the same scenario, the probabilities you calculated should be different. Can you explain the reason for this discrepancy?

\eoce{\qt{Customers at a coffee shop, Part I} \label{coffee} A coffee shop serves an average of 75 customers per hour during the morning rush.
\begin{parts}
\item Which distribution we have studied is most appropriate for calculating the probability of a given number of customers arriving within one hour during this time of day?
\item What are the mean and the standard deviation of the number of customers this coffee shop serves in one hour during this time of day?
\item Would it be considered unusually low if only 60 customers showed up to this coffee shop in one hour during this time of day?

\item What are the mean and the standard deviation of the number of typos this stenographer makes?
