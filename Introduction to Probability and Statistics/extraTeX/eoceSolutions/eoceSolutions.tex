\eocesol{(a) Treatment: $10/43 = 0.23 \rightarrow 23\%$. Control: $2/46 = 0.04 \rightarrow 4\%$. (b) There is a 19\% difference between the pain reduction rates in the two groups. At first glance, it appears patients in the treatment group are more likely to experience pain reduction from the acupuncture treatment. (c) Answers may vary but should be sensible. Two possible answers: $^1$Though the groups' difference is big, I'm skeptical the results show a real difference and think this might be due to chance. $^2$The difference in these rates looks pretty big, so I suspect acupuncture is having a positive impact on pain.}

\eocesol{(a-i) 143,196 eligible study subjects born in Southern California between 1989 and 1993. (a-ii) Measurements of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10$\mu g/m^3$ (PM$_{10}$) collected at air-quality-monitoring stations as well as length of gestation. These are continuous numerical variables. (a-iii) The research question: ``Is there an association between air pollution exposure and preterm births?" (b-i) 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. (b-ii) The variables were whether or not the patient practiced the Buteyko method (categorical) and measures of quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms and medication reduction of the patients (categorical, ordinal). It may also be reasonable to treat the ratings on a scale of 1 to 10 as discrete numerical variables. (b-iii) The research question: ``Do asthmatic patients who practice the Buteyko method experience improvement in their condition?"}

% 5
\eocesol{(a) $50 \times 3 = 150$. (b) Four continuous numerical variables: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. (c) One categorical variable, species, with three levels: \emph{setosa}, \emph{versicolor}, and \emph{virginica}.}

% 7
\eocesol{(a) Population of interest: all births in Southern California. Sample: 143,196 births between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. If births in this time span can be considered to be representative of all births, then the results are generalizable to the population of Southern California. However, since the study is observational, the findings do not imply causal relationships. (b) Population: all 18-69 year olds diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. Sample: 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. Since the sample consists of voluntary patients, the results cannot necessarily be generalized to the population at large. However, since the study is an experiment, the findings can be used to establish causal relationships.}

% 9
\eocesol{(a) Explanatory: number of study hours per week. Response: GPA. 
(b) There is a slight positive relationship between the two variables. One respondent reported a GPA above 4.0, which is a data error. There are also a few respondents who reported unusually high study hours (60 and 70 hours/week). The variability in GPA also appears to be larger for students who study less than those who study more. Since the data become sparse as the number of study hours increases, it is somewhat difficult to evaluate the strength of the relationship and also the variability across different numbers of study hours.
(c) Observational.
(d) Since this is an observational study, a causal relationship is not implied.}

% 11
\eocesol{(a) Observational.
(b) The professor suspects students in a given section may have similar feelings about the course. To ensure each section is reasonably represented, she may choose to randomly select a fixed number of students, say 10, from each section for a total sample size of 40 students. Since a random sample of fixed size was taken within each section in this scenario, this represents stratified sampling.}

% 13
\eocesol{Sampling from the phone book would miss unlisted phone numbers, so this would result in bias. People who do not have their numbers listed may share certain characteristics, e.g. consider that cell phones are not listed in phone books, so a sample from the phone book would not necessarily be a representative of the population.}

% 15
\eocesol{The estimate will be biased, and it will tend to overestimate the true family size. For example, suppose we had just two families: the first with 2 parents and 5 children, and the second with 2 parents and 1 child. Then if we draw one of the six children at random, 5 times out of 6 we would sample the larger family}

% 17
\eocesol{(a) No, this is an observational study.
(b) This statement is not justified; it implies a causal association between sleep disorders and bullying. However, this was an observational study. A better conclusion would be ``School children identified as bullies are more likely to suffer from sleep disorders than non-bullies.''}

% 19
\eocesol{(a) Experiment, as the treatment was assigned to each patient.
(b)~Response: Duration of the cold. Explanatory: Treatment, with 4 levels: \emph{placebo}, \emph{1g}, \emph{3g}, \emph{3g with additives}.
(c)~Patients were blinded.
(d)~Double-blind with respect to the researchers evaluating the patients, but the nurses who briefly interacted with patients during the distribution of the medication were not blinded. We could say the study was partly double-blind.
(e)~No. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups and were blinded, so we would expect about an equal number of patients in each group to not adhere to the treatment.}

% 21
\eocesol{(a) Experiment.
(b)~Treatment is exercise twice a week. Control is no exercise. 
(c)~Yes, the blocking variable is age.
(d)~No.
(e)~This is an experiment, so a causal conclusion is reasonable. Since the sample is random, the conclusion can be generalized to the population at large. However, we must consider that a placebo effect is possible. 
(f)~Yes. Randomly sampled people should not be required to participate in a clinical trial, and there are also ethical concerns about the plan to instruct one group not to participate in a healthy behavior, which in this case is exercise.}

% 23
\eocesol{(a) Positive association: mammals with longer gestation periods tend to live longer as well.
(b)~Association would still be positive.
(c)~No, they are not independent. See part~(a).}

% 25
\eocesol{(a) 1/linear and 3/nonlinear.
(b)~4/some curvature (nonlinearity) may be present on the right side. ``Linear'' would also be acceptable for the type of relationship for plot~4.
(c)~2.}

% 27
\eocesol{(a)~Decrease: the new score is smaller than the mean of the 24 previous scores.
(b)~Calculate a weighted mean. Use a weight of 24 for the old mean and 1 for the new mean: $(24\times 74 + 1\times64)/(24+1) = 73.6$. There are other ways to solve this exercise that do not use a weighted mean.
(c)~The new score is more than 1 standard deviation away from the previous mean, so increase.}

% 29
\eocesol{Both distributions are right skewed and bimodal with modes at 10 and 20 cigarettes; note that people may be rounding their answers to half a pack or a whole pack. The median of each distribution is between 10 and 15 cigarettes. The middle 50\% of the data (the IQR) appears to be spread equally in each group and have a width of about 10 to 15. There are potential outliers above 40 cigarettes per day. It appears that respondents who smoke only a few cigarettes (0 to 5) smoke more on the weekdays than on weekends.}

% 31
\eocesol{(a) $\bar{x}_{amtWeekends} = 20$, $\bar{x}_{amtWeekdays} = 16$.
(b) $s_{amtWeekends} = 0$, $s_{amtWeekdays} = 4.18$. In this very small sample, higher on weekdays.}

% 33
\eocesol{(a) Both distributions have the same median and IQR.
(b) Second distribution has a higher median and higher IQR.
(c) Second distribution has higher median. IQRs are equal.
(d) Second distribution has higher median and larger IQR.}

\eocesol{Descriptions will vary a little. (a)~2. Unimodal, symmetric, centered at 60, standard deviation of roughly 3.
(b)~3. Symmetric and approximately evenly distributed from 0 to 100.
(c)~1. Right skewed, unimodal, centered at about 1.5, with most observations falling between 0 and 3. A very small fraction of observations exceed a value of 5.}

% 39
\eocesol{The histogram shows that the distribution is bimodal, which is not apparent in the box plot. The box plot makes it easy to identify more precise values of observations outside of the whiskers.}

% 41
\eocesol{(a) The median is better; the mean is substantially affected by the two extreme observations.
(b) The IQR is better; the standard deviation, like the mean, is substantially affected by the two high salaries.}

% 43
\eocesol{The distribution is unimodal and symmetric with a mean of about 25 minutes and a standard deviation of about 5 minutes. There does not appear to be any counties with unusually high or low mean travel times. Since the distribution is already unimodal and symmetric, a log transformation is not necessary.}

% 45
\eocesol{Answers will vary. There are pockets of longer travel time around DC, Southeastern NY, Chicago, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and many other big cities. There is also a large section of shorter average commute times that overlap with farmland in the Midwest. Many farmers' homes are adjacent to their farmland, so their commute would be 0 minutes, which may explain why the average commute time for these counties is relatively low.}

% 47
\eocesol{(a)~We see the order of the categories and the relative frequencies in the bar plot.
(b)~There are no features that are apparent in the pie chart but not in the bar plot.
(c)~We usually prefer to use a bar plot as we can also see the relative frequencies of the categories in this graph.}

% 49
\eocesol{The vertical locations at which the ideological groups break into the Yes, No, and Not Sure categories differ, which indicates the variables are dependent.}

% 51
\eocesol{(a) False. Instead of comparing counts, we should compare percentages.
(b)~True.
(c) False. We cannot infer a causal relationship from an association in an observational study. However, we can say the drug a person is on affects his risk in this case, as he chose that drug and his choice may be associated with other variables, which is why part~(b) is true. The difference in these statements is subtle but important.
(d)~True.}

% 53
\eocesol{(a) Proportion who had heart attack: $\frac{7,979}{227,571} \approx 0.035$
(b) Expected number of cardiovascular problems in the rosiglitazone group if having cardiovascular problems and treatment were independent can be calculated as the number of patients in that group multiplied by the overall rate of cardiovascular problems in the study: $\text{67,593} \times \frac{\text{7,979}}{\text{227,571}} \approx 2370$.
(c-i) $H_0$: Independence model. The treatment and cardiovascular problems are independent. They have no relationship, and the difference in incidence rates between the rosiglitazone and pioglitazone groups is due to chance.
$H_A$: Alternate model. The treatment and cardiovascular problems are not independent. The difference in the incidence rates between the rosiglitazone and pioglitazone groups is not due to chance, and rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems.
(c-ii) A higher number of patients with cardiovascular problems in the rosiglitazone group than expected under the assumption of independence would provide support for the alternative hypothesis. This would suggest that rosiglitazone increases the risk of such problems.
(c-iii) In the actual study, we observed 2,593 cardiovascular events in the rosiglitazone group. In the 1,000 simulations under the independence model, we observed somewhat less than 2,593 in all simulations, which suggests that the actual results did not come from the independence model. That is, the analysis provides strong evidence that the variables are not independent, and we reject the independence model in favor of the alternative. The study's results provide strong evidence that rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems.}

(b) 100 tosses. More flips means the observed proportion of heads would often be closer to the average, 0.50, and therefore also above 0.40.
(c) 100 tosses. With more flips, the observed proportion of heads would often be closer to the average, 0.50.

(d)~Add up the corresponding disjoint sections in the Venn diagram: $0.24 + 0.11 + 0.12 = 0.47$. Alternatively, use the General Addition Rule: $0.35 + 0.23 - 0.11 = 0.47$.
(e)~$1 - 0.47 = 0.53$.
(f)~$P$(Independent) $\times$ $P$(swing) = $0.35\times0.23 = 0.08$, which does not equal P(Independent and swing) = 0.11, so the events are dependent.

The sample size is at least 30. The data are only slightly skewed. Under the assumption that the random sample is a simple random sample, $\bar{x}$ will be normally distributed. $H_0: \mu = 7$~hours. $H_A: \mu \ne 7$~hours. $Z=-1.04 \to$ p-value$=2\times0.1492 = 0.2984$. Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide convincing evidence that the average lifespan of all ball bearings produced by this machine is different than 7 hours.

(b)~$H_0: \mu = 18$. $H_A: \mu > 18$. $Z=3.46$ $\to$ p-value $=0.0003$, which is less than $\alpha=0.05$, so we reject $H_0$. There is strong evidence that the average revenue per customer is greater than \$18.
(c)~(18.65, 19.85).
(d)~Yes. The hypothesis test reject the notion that $\mu=18$, and this value is not in the confidence interval.
(e)~Even though the increase in average revenue per customer appears to be significant, the restaurant owner may want to consider other criteria, such as total profits. With a longer happy hour, the revenue over the entire evening may actually drop since lower prices are offered for a longer time. Also, costs usually rise when prices are lowered. A better measure to consider may be an increase in total profits for the entire evening.}

\eocesol{(a)~The distribution is unimodal and strongly right skewed with a median between 5 and 10 years old. Ages range from 0 to slightly over 50 years old, and the middle 50\% of the distribution is roughly between 5 and 15 years old. There are potential outliers on the higher end.
(b)~When the sample size is small, the sampling distribution is right skewed, just like the population distribution. As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution gets more unimodal, symmetric, and approaches normality. The variability also decreases. This is consistent with the Central Limit Theorem.}

(d)~Even though the population distribution is not normal, the conditions for inference are reasonably satisfied, with the possible exception of skew. If the skew isn't very strong (we should ask to see the data), then we can use the Central Limit Theorem to estimate this probability. For now, we'll assume the skew isn't very strong, though the description suggests it is at least moderate to strong. Use $N(1.3, SE_{\bar{x}} = 0.3/\sqrt{60})$: $Z=2.58$ $\to$ 0.0049.

\eocesol{(a)~$Z=-3.33$ $\to$ 0.0004.

% 41
\eocesol{(a)~We cannot use the normal model for this calculation, but we can use the histogram. About 500 songs are shown to be longer than 5 minutes, so the probability is about $500/3000 = 0.167$.
(b)~Two different answers are reasonable. $^{Option~1}$Since the population distribution is only slightly skewed to the right, even a small sample size will yield a nearly normal sampling distribution. We also know that the songs are sampled randomly and the sample size is less than 10\% of the population, so the length of one song in the sample is independent of another.  We are looking for the probability that the total length of 15 songs is more than 60 minutes, which means that the average song should last at least $60/15 = 4$ minutes. Using $SE=1.62/\sqrt{15}$, $Z=1.31$ $\to$ 0.0951. $^{Option~2}$Since the population distribution is not normal, a small sample size may not be sufficient to yield a nearly normal sampling distribution. Therefore, we cannot estimate the probability using the tools we have learned so far.

\eocesol{(a)~The null hypothesis would be that the mean this year is also 128 minutes. The alternative hypothesis would be that the mean is different from 128 minutes.
(b)~First calculate the SE: $\frac{39}{\sqrt{64}} = 4.875$. Next, identify the Z scores that would result in rejecting $H_0$: $Z_{lower} = -1.96$, $Z_{upper} = 1.96$. In each case, calculate the corresponding sample mean cutoff: $\bar{x}_{lower} = 118.445$ and $\bar{x}_{upper} = 137.555$.
(c)~Construct Z scores for the values from part~(b) but using the supposed true distribution (i.e. $\mu=135$), i.e. not using the null value ($\mu=128$). The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis would be $0.0003 + 0.3015 = 0.3018$ using these two cutoffs, and the probability of a Type~2 error would then be $1-0.3018 = 0.6982$.}
%(c)~As before, compute cutoffs for rejecting the null hypothesis ($\bar{x}_{lower}=115.42$ and $\bar{x}_{upper}140.58$). Next compute the Z score, and then compute the probability of the sample mean falling above or below each of these numbers when the actual mean is $\mu=135$ (about 0 and 0.1271). So the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ is about 0.1271, and the probability of a Type~2 error is about $1-0.1271 = 0.8729$.}

\eocesol{(a)~These data are paired. For example, the Friday the 13th in say, September 1991, would probably be more similar to the Friday the 6th in September 1991 than to Friday the 6th in another month or year.
(b)~Let $\mu_{diff} = \mu_{sixth} - \mu_{thirteenth}$. $H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$. $H_A: \mu_{diff} \ne 0$.
(c)~Independence: The months selected are not random. However, if we think these dates are roughly equivalent to a simple random sample of all such Friday 6th/13th date pairs, then independence is reasonable. To proceed, we must make this strong assumption, though we should note this assumption in any reported results. With fewer than 10 observations, we would need to use the $t$ distribution to model the sample mean. The normal probability plot of the differences shows an approximately straight line. There isn't a clear reason why this distribution would be skewed, and since the normal quantile plot looks reasonable, we can mark this condition as reasonably satisfied.
(d)~$T = 4.94$ for $df=10-1=9$ $\to$ p-value $<0.01$.

(We might believe this intersection is representative of all roads, i.e. there is higher traffic on Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ relative to Friday the 13$^{\text{th}}$. However, we should be cautious of the required assumption for such a generalization.)
(f)~If the average number of cars passing the intersection actually was the same on Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ and $13^{th}$, then the probability that we would observe a test statistic so far from zero is less than 0.01.

The data provide strong evidence that the average number of traffic accident related emergency room admissions are different between Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ and Friday the 13$^{\text{th}}$.

\eocesol{Let $\mu_{diff} = \mu_{pre} - \mu_{post}$. $H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$: Treatment has no effect. $H_A: \mu_{diff} > 0$: Treatment is effective in reducing Pd T scores, the average pre-treatment score is higher than the average post-treatment score. Note that the reported values are pre minus post, so we are looking for a positive difference, which would correspond to a reduction in the psychopathic deviant T score. Conditions are checked as follows. Independence: The subjects are randomly assigned to treatments, so the patients in each group are independent. All three sample sizes are smaller than 30, so we use $t$ tests.Distributions of differences are somewhat skewed. The sample sizes are small, so we cannot reliably relax this assumption. (We will proceed, but we would not report the results of this specific analysis, at least for treatment group 1.) For all three groups: $df=13$. $T_1= 1.89$ ($0.025<$ p-value $<0.05$), $T_2=1.35$ (p-value = 0.10), $T_3 = -1.40$ (p-value $>0.10$). The only significant test reduction is found in Treatment 1, however, we had earlier noted that this result might not be reliable due to the skew in the distribution. Note that the calculation of the p-value for Treatment 3 was unnecessary: the sample mean indicated a increase in Pd T scores under this treatment (as opposed to a decrease, which was the result of interest). That is, we could tell without formally completing the hypothesis test that the p-value would be large for this treatment group.}

Approx. normal: the distributions of weights within each feed type appear to be fairly symmetric. Constant variance: Based on the side-by-side box plots, the constant variance assumption appears to be reasonable. There are differences in the actual computed standard deviations, but these might be due to chance as these are quite small samples. $F_{5,65} = 15.36$ and the p-value is approximately 0. With such a small p-value, we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that the average weight of chicks varies across some (or all) feed supplement groups.}

In practice, we would inquire for more details. Approx. normal: The data are bound below by zero and the standard deviations are larger than the means, indicating very strong strong skew. However, since the sample sizes are extremely large, even extreme skew is acceptable.

Use the following hypotheses for each pairwise test. $H_0$: The two means are equal. $H_A$: The two means are different. The sample sizes are equal and we use the pooled SD, so we can compute $SE=3.7$ with the pooled $df=39$. The p-value only for Trmt 1 vs. Trmt 3 may be statistically significant: $0.01<$ p-value $<0.02$. Since we cannot tell, we should use a computer to get the p-value, 0.015, which is statistically significant for the adjusted significance level. That is, we have identified Treatment 1 and Treatment 3 as having different effects. Checking the other two comparisons, the differences are not statistically significant.}

$X^2 = 11.47$, $df = 2$ $\to$ $0.001<$ p-value $<0.005$.
Since the p-value $< \alpha$, we reject $H_0$.  There is strong evidence that there is an association between support for off-shore drilling and having a college degree.}

The sample is random, all expected counts are above 5, and $df=(3-1)\times(2-1) = 2 > 1$, so we may proceed with the test.} %The test statistic may be computed as $X^2 = 3.1291$ with $df= 2$. The p-value is greater than 0.2, indicating that the evidence is not sufficiently strong for us to reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data do not provide sufficiently strong evidence to conclude that Facebook users knowledge about privacy settings varies by gender.}

(c)~The success-failure condition is not satisfied; note that it is appropriate to use the null value ($p_0 = 0.69$) to compute the expected number of successes and failures.
(d)~Answers may vary. Each student can be represented with a card. Take 100 cards, 69 black cards representing those who follow the news about Egypt and 31 red cards representing those who do not. Shuffle the cards and draw with replacement (shuffling each time in between draws) 30 cards representing the 30 high school students. Calculate the proportion of black cards in this sample, $\hat{p}_{sim}$, i.e. the proportion of those who follow the news in the simulation. Repeat this many times (e.g. 10,000 times) and plot the resulting sample proportions. The p-value will be two times the proportion of simulations where $\hat{p}_{sim} \le 0.57$. (Note: we would generally use a computer to perform these simulations.)
(e)~The p-value is about $0.001 + 0.005 + 0.020 + 0.035 + 0.075 = 0.136$, meaning the two-sided p-value is about 0.272. Your p-value may vary slightly since it is based on a visual estimate. Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide strong evidence that the proportion of high school students who followed the news about Egypt is different than the proportion of American adults who did.}

(Students may have approximate results, and a small number of students may have a p-value of about 0.05.) Since the p-value is low, we reject $H_0$.

\eocesol{(a)~The relationship is positive, weak, and possibly linear. However, there do appear to be some anomalous observations along the left where several students have the same height that is notably far from the cloud of the other points. Additionally, there are many students who appear not to have driven a car, and they are represented by a set of points along the bottom of the scatterplot.
(b)~There is no obvious explanation why simply being tall should lead a person to drive faster. However, one confounding factor is gender. Males tend to be taller than females on average, and personal experiences (anecdotal) may suggest they drive faster. If we were to follow-up on this suspicion, we would find that sociological studies confirm this suspicion.
(c)~Males are taller on average and they drive faster. The gender variable is indeed an important confounding variable.}

\eocesol{(a)~There is a somewhat weak, positive, possibly linear relationship between the distance traveled and travel time. There is clustering near the lower left corner that we should take special note of.
(b)~Changing the units will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables. If longer distances measured in miles are associated with longer travel time measured in minutes, longer distances measured in kilometers will be associated with longer travel time measured in hours.
(c)~Changing units doesn't affect correlation: $R = 0.636$.}

\eocesol{(a)~There is a moderate, positive, and linear relationship between shoulder girth and height.

\eocesol{In each part, we may write the husband ages as a linear function of the wife ages: (a) $age_{H} = age_{W} + 3$; (b) $age_{H} = age_{W} - 2$; and (c) $age_{H} = 2 \times age_{W}$. Therefore, the correlation will be exactly 1 in all three parts. An alternative way to gain insight into this solution is to create a mock data set, such as a data set of 5 women with ages 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30 (or some other set of ages). Then, based on the description, say for part (a), we can compute their husbands' ages as 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33. We can plot these points to see they fall on a straight line, and they always will. The same approach can be applied to the other parts as well.}

\eocesol{(a)~There is a positive, very strong, linear association between the number of tourists and spending.
(b)~Explanatory: number of tourists (in thousands). Response: spending (in millions of US dollars).
(c)~We can predict spending for a given number of tourists using a regression line. This may be useful information for determining how much the country may want to spend in advertising abroad, or to forecast expected revenues from tourism.
(d)~Even though the relationship appears linear in the scatterplot, the residual plot actually shows a nonlinear relationship. This is not a contradiction: residual plots can show divergences from linearity that can be difficult to see in a scatterplot. A simple linear model is inadequate for modeling these data. It is also important to consider that these data are observed sequentially, which means there may be a hidden structure that it is not evident in the current data but that is important to consider.}

% 19

\eocesol{(a)~First calculate the slope: $b_1 = R\times s_y/s_x = 0.636\times113/99 = 0.726$. Next, make use of the fact that the regression line passes through the point $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$: $\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \times \bar{x}$. Plug in $\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$, and $b_1$, and solve for $b_0$: 51. Solution: $\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \times distance$.
(b)~$b_1$: For each additional mile in distance, the model predicts an additional 0.726 minutes in travel time. $b_0$: When the distance traveled is 0 miles, the travel time is expected to be 51 minutes. It does not make sense to have a travel distance of 0 miles in this context. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself.
(c)~$R^2 = 0.636^2 = 0.40$. About 40\% of the variability in travel time is accounted for by the model, i.e. explained by the distance traveled.
(d)~$\widehat{travel~time} =  51 + 0.726 \times distance = 51 + 0.726 \times 103 \approx 126$ minutes. (Note: we should be cautious in our predictions with this model since we have not yet evaluated whether it is a well-fit model.)
(e)~$e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = 168 - 126 = 42$ minutes. A positive residual means that the model underestimates the travel time.
(f)~No, this calculation would require extrapolation.}

% 21

\eocesol{The relationship between the variables is somewhat linear. However, there are two apparent outliers. The residuals do not show a random scatter around 0. A simple linear model may not be appropriate for these data, and we should investigate the two outliers.}

% 23

\eocesol{(a)~$\sqrt{R^2} = 0.849$. Since the trend is negative, $R$ is also negative: $R=-0.849$.
(b)~$b_0 = 55.34$. $b_1 = -0.537$.
(c)~For a neighborhood with 0\% reduced-fee lunch, we would expect 55.34\% of the bike riders to wear helmets.
(d)~For every additional percentage point of reduced fee lunches in a neighborhood, we would expect 0.537\% fewer kids to be wearing helmets. %For every additional percentage point of lunch, there is a decrease of 0.537 percentage points in helmet.
(e)~$\hat{y} = 40\times(-0.537)+55.34 = 33.86$, $e = 40 - \hat y = 6.14$. There are 6.14\% more bike riders wearing helmets than predicted by the regression model in this neighborhood.}

% 25

\eocesol{(a)~The outlier is in the upper-left corner. Since it is horizontally far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. Since the slope of the regression line would be very different if fit without this point, it is also an influential point.
(b)~The outlier is located in the lower-left corner. It is horizontally far from the rest of the data, so it is a high-leverage point. The line again would look notably different if the fit excluded this point, meaning it the outlier is influential.
(c)~The outlier is in the upper-middle of the plot. Since it is near the horizontal center of the data, it is not a high-leverage point. This means it also will have little or no influence on the slope of the regression line.}

% 27

\eocesol{(a)~There is a negative, moderate-to-strong, somewhat linear relationship between percent of families who own their home and the percent of the population living in urban areas in 2010. There is one outlier: a state where 100\% of the population is urban. The variability in the percent of homeownership also increases as we move from left to right in the plot.
(b)~The outlier is located in the bottom right corner, horizontally far from the center of the other points, so it is a point with high leverage. It is an influential point since excluding this point from the analysis would greatly affect the slope of the regression line.}

% 29

\eocesol{(a)~The relationship is positive, moderate-to-strong, and linear. There are a few outliers but no points that appear to be influential.
(b)~$\widehat{weight} = -105.0113 + 1.0176 \times height$. Slope: For each additional centimeter in height, the model predicts the average weight to be 1.0176 additional kilograms (about 2.2 pounds).  Intercept: People who are 0 centimeters tall are expected to weigh -105.0113 kilograms. This is obviously not possible. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself.
(c)~$H_0$: The true slope coefficient of height is zero ($\beta_1 = 0$). $H_0$: The true slope coefficient of height is greater than zero ($\beta_1 > 0$). A two-sided test would also be acceptable for this application. The p-value for the two-sided alternative hypothesis ($\beta_1 \ne 0$) is incredibly small, so the p-value for the one-sided hypothesis will be even smaller. That is, we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that height and weight are positively correlated. The true slope parameter is indeed greater than~0.
(d)~$R^2 = 0.72^2 = 0.52$. Approximately 52\% of the variability in weight can be explained by the height of individuals.}

% 31

\eocesol{(a)~$H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$. $H_A$: $\beta_1 > 0$. A two-sided test would also be acceptable for this application. The p-value, as reported in the table, is incredibly small. Thus, for a one-sided test, the p-value will also be incredibly small, and we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that wives' and husbands' heights are positively correlated. %However, whether this information is practically significant is unclear.
(b)~$\widehat{height}_{W} = 43.5755 + 0.2863 \times height_{H}$.
(c)~Slope: For each additional inch in husband's height, the average wife's height is expected to be an additional 0.2863 inches on average. Intercept: Men who are 0 inches tall are expected to have wives who are, on average, 43.5755 inches tall. The intercept here is meaningless, and it serves only to adjust the height of the line.
(d)~The slope is positive, so $R$ must also be positive. $R = \sqrt{0.09} = 0.30$.
(e)~63.2612. Since $R^2$ is low, the prediction based on this regression model is not very reliable.
(f)~No, we should avoid extrapolating.}

% 33

\eocesol{(a)~25.75.
(b)~$H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$. $H_A$: $\beta_1 \ne 0$. A one-sided test also may be reasonable for this application. $T=2.23$, $df=23$ $\to$ p-value between 0.02 and 0.05. So we reject $H_0$. There is an association between gestational age and head circumference. We can also say that the associaation is positive.}

(c)~$H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$. $H_A$: $\beta_1 \ne 0$. $T= -8.65$, and the p-value is approximately 0. Since the p-value is very small, we reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the true slope parameter is different than 0 and that there is an association between birth weight and smoking. Furthermore, having rejected $H_0$, we can conclude that smoking is associated with lower birth weights.}

\eocesol{Based on the p-value alone, either gestation or smoke should be added to the model first. However, since the adjusted $R^2$ for the model with gestation is higher, it would be preferable to add gestation in the first step of the forward-selection algorithm.

\eocesol{Nearly normal residuals: The normal probability plot shows a nearly normal distribution of the residuals, however, there are some minor irregularities at the tails. With a data set so large, these would not be a concern. \\ Constant variability of residuals: The scatterplot of the residuals versus the fitted values does not show any overall structure. However, values that have very low or very high fitted values appear to also have somewhat larger outliers. In addition, the residuals do appear to have constant variability between the two parity and smoking status groups, though these items are relatively minor. \\ Independent residuals: The scatterplot of residuals versus the order of data collection shows a random scatter, suggesting that there is no apparent structures related to the order the data were collected. \\ Linear relationships between the response variable and numerical explanatory variables: The residuals vs. height and weight of mother are randomly distributed around 0. The residuals vs. length of gestation plot also does not show any clear or strong remaining structures, with the possible exception of very short or long gestations. The rest of the residuals do appear to be randomly distributed around 0. \\All concerns raised here are relatively mild. There are some outliers, but there is so much data that the influence of such observations will be minor.}

% 13
\eocesol{(a)~There are a few potential outliers, e.g. on the left in the \var{total\_\hspace{0.3mm}length} variable, but nothing that will be of serious concern in a data set this large.
(b)~When coefficient estimates are sensitive to which variables are included in the model, this typically indicates that some variables are collinear. For example, a possum's gender may be related to its head length, which would explain why the coefficient (and p-value) for \var{sex\_\hspace{0.3mm}male} changed when we removed the \var{head\_\hspace{0.3mm}length} variable. Likewise, a possum's skull width is likely to be related to its head length, probably even much more closely related than the head length was to gender.}

\eocesol{(a)~The logistic model relating $\hat{p}_i$ to the predictors may be written as

(b)~$\hat{p} = 0.0062$. While the probability is very near zero, we have not run diagnostics on the model. We might also be a little skeptical that the model will remain accurate for a possum found in a US zoo. For example, perhaps the zoo selected a possum with specific characteristics but only looked in one region. On the other hand, it is encouraging that the possum was caught in the wild. (Answers regarding the reliability of the model probability will vary.)}
