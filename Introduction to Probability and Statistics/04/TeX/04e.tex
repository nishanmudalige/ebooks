\subsection{Confidence intervals}

% 7

\eoce{\qt{Relaxing after work} \label{relax} The General Social Survey (GSS) is a sociological survey used to collect data on demographic characteristics and attitudes of residents of the United States. In 2010, the survey collected responses from 1,154 US residents. The survey is conducted face-to-face with an in-person interview of a randomly-selected sample of adults. One of the questions on the survey is ``After an average work day, about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?" A 95\% confidence interval from the 2010 GSS survey is 3.53 to 3.83 hours.\footfullcite{data:gss:2010}
\begin{parts}
\item Interpret this interval in the context of the data.
\item What does a 95\% confidence level mean in this context?
%\item If the researchers who conducted this survey wanted to report a confidence interval with a smaller margin of error based on the same sample of 1,154 Americans, would the confidence level be larger, smaller, or about the same?
\item Suppose the researchers think a 90\% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval. Will this new interval be smaller or larger than the 95\% confidence interval? Assume the standard deviation has remained constant since 2010.
\end{parts}
}{}

% 8

\eoce{\qt{Mental health} Another question on the General Social Survey introduced in Exercise~\ref{relax} is ``For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, not good?" Based on responses from 1,151 US residents, the survey reported a 95\% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.
\begin{parts}
\item Interpret this interval in context of the data.
\item What does a 95\% confidence level mean in this context?
\item Suppose the researchers think a 99\% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval. Will this new interval be smaller or larger than the 95\% confidence interval?
\item If a new survey asking the same questions was to be done with 500 Americans, would the standard error of the estimate be larger, smaller, or about the same. Assume the standard deviation has remained constant since 2010.

\eoce{\qt{Width of a confidence interval} Earlier in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference}, we calculated the 99\% confidence interval for the average age of runners in the 2012 Cherry Blossom Run as (32.7, 37.4) based on a sample of 100 runners. How could we decrease the width of this interval without losing confidence?

% 10

\eoce{\qt{Confidence levels} If a higher confidence level means that we are more confident about the number we are reporting, why don't we always report a confidence interval with the highest possible confidence level?

\eoce{\qt{Waiting at an ER, Part I} \label{ERwait} A hospital administrator hoping to improve wait times decides to estimate the average emergency room waiting time at her hospital. He collects a simple random sample of 64 patients and determines the time (in minutes) between when they checked in to the ER until they were first seen by a doctor. A 95\% confidence interval based on this sample is (128 minutes, 147 minutes), which is based on the normal model for the mean. Determine whether the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning for those statements you identify as false.
\begin{parts}

\item This confidence interval is not valid since we do not know if the population distribution of the ER wait times is nearly normal.

\item We are 95\% confident that the average waiting time of these 64 emergency room patients is between 128 and 147 minutes.

\item We are 95\% confident that the average waiting time of all patients at this hospital's emergency room is between 128 and 147 minutes.

\item 95\% of such random samples would have a sample mean between 128 and 147 minutes.

\item A 99\% confidence interval would be narrower than the 95\% confidence interval since we need to be more sure of our estimate.

\item The margin of error is 9.5 and the sample mean is 137.5.

\item In order to decrease the margin of error of a 95\% confidence interval to half of what it is now, we would need to double the sample size.

\eoce{\qt{Thanksgiving spending, Part I} \label{holidaySpending} The 2009 holiday retail season, which kicked off on November 27, 2009 (the day after Thanksgiving), had been marked by somewhat lower self-reported consumer spending than was seen during the comparable period in 2008. To get an estimate of consumer spending, 436 randomly sampled American adults were surveyed. Daily consumer spending for the six-day period after Thanksgiving, spanning the Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday, averaged \$84.71. A 95\% confidence interval based on this sample is (\$80.31, \$89.11). Determine whether the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.\vspaceB{-3mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{04/figures/eoce/tgSpending/tgSpending}
\end{center}\vspaceB{-2mm}
\begin{parts}
\item We are 95\% confident that the average spending of these 436 American adults is between \$80.31 and \$89.11.
\item This confidence interval is not valid since the distribution of spending in the sample is right skewed.
\item 95\% of such random samples would have a sample mean between \$80.31 and \$89.11.
\item We are 95\% confident that the average spending of all American adults is between \$80.31 and \$89.11.
\item A 90\% confidence interval would be narrower than the 95\% confidence interval.
\item In order to decrease the margin of error of a 95\% confidence interval to a third of what it is now, we would need to use a sample 3 times larger.
\item The margin of error for the reported interval is 4.4.

\eoce{\qt{Exclusive relationships} A survey was conducted on 203 undergraduates from Duke University who took an introductory statistics course in Spring 2012. Among many other questions, this survey asked them about the number of exclusive relationships they have been in. The histogram below shows the distribution of the data from this sample. The sample average is 3.2 with a standard deviation of 1.97.

\eoce{\qt{Age at first marriage, Part I} \label{ageAtMar} The National Survey of Family Growth conducted by the Centers for Disease Control gathers information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men's and women's health. One of the variables collected on this survey is the age at first marriage. The histogram below shows the distribution of ages at first marriage of 5,534 randomly sampled women between 2006 and 2010. The average age at first marriage among these women is 23.44 with a standard deviation of 4.72.\footfullcite{data:nsfg:2010}

\eoce{\qt{Identify hypotheses, Part I} Write the null and alternative hypotheses in words and then symbols for each of the following situations.
\begin{parts}
\item New York is known as ``the city that never sleeps". A random sample of 25 New Yorkers were asked how much sleep they get per night. Do these data provide convincing evidence that New Yorkers on average sleep less than 8 hours a night?
\item Employers at a firm are worried about the effect of March Madness, a basketball championship held each spring in the US, on employee productivity. They estimate that on a regular business day employees spend on average 15 minutes of company time checking personal email, making personal phone calls, etc. They also collect data on how much company time employees spend on such non-business activities during March Madness. They want to determine if these data provide convincing evidence that employee productivity decreases during March Madness.

\eoce{\qt{Identify hypotheses, Part II} Write the null and alternative hypotheses in words and using symbols for each of the following situations.
\begin{parts}
\item Since 2008, chain restaurants in California have been required to display calorie counts of each menu item. Prior to menus displaying calorie counts, the average calorie intake of diners at a restaurant was 1100 calories. After calorie counts started to be displayed on menus, a nutritionist collected data on the number of calories consumed at this restaurant from a random sample of diners. Do these data provide convincing evidence of a difference in the average calorie intake of a diners at this restaurant?
\item Based on the performance of those who took the GRE exam between July 1, 2004 and June 30, 2007, the average Verbal Reasoning score was calculated to be 462.

\item Are conditions for inference satisfied?
\item Suppose you read on a parenting website that children first count to 10 successfully when they are 32 months old, on average. Perform a hypothesis test to evaluate if these data provide convincing evidence that the average age at which gifted children first count to 10 successfully is different than the general average of 32 months. Use a significance level of 0.10.
\item Interpret the p-value in context of the hypothesis test and the data.

\eoce{\qt{Waiting at an ER, Part III} \label{ERWaitHT} The hospital administrator mentioned in Exercise~\ref{ERwait} randomly selected 64 patients and measured the time (in minutes) between when they checked in to the ER and the time they were first seen by a doctor. The average time is 137.5 minutes and the standard deviation is 39 minutes. He is getting grief from his supervisor on the basis that the wait times in the ER increased greatly from last year's average of 127 minutes. However, the administrator claims that the increase is probably just due to chance. 
\begin{parts}
\item Are conditions for inference met? Note any assumptions you must make to proceed.
\item Using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, is the change in wait times statistically significant? Use a two-sided test since it seems the supervisor had to inspect the data before he suggested an increase occurred.
\item Would the conclusion of the hypothesis test change if the significance level was changed to $\alpha = 0.01$?

\eoce{\qt{Errors in drug testing} Suppose regulators monitored 403 drugs last year, each for a particular adverse response. For each drug they conducted a single hypothesis test with a significance level of 5\% to determine if the adverse effect was higher in those taking the drug than those who did not take the drug; the regulators ultimately rejected the null hypothesis for 42 drugs.
\begin{parts}
\item Describe the error the regulators might have made for a drug where the null hypothesis was rejected.
\item Describe the error regulators might have made for a drug where the null hypothesis was not rejected.
\item Suppose the vast majority of the 403 drugs do not have adverse effects. Then, if you picked one of the 42 suspect drugs at random, about how sure would you be that the drug really has an adverse effect?

\eoce{\qt{Car insurance savings, Part I} \label{carInsurance} A car insurance company advertises that customers switching to their insurance save, on average, \$432 on their yearly premiums. A market researcher at a competing insurance discounter is interested in showing that this value is an overestimate so he can provide evidence to government regulators that the company is falsely advertising their prices. He randomly samples 82 customers who recently switched to this insurance and finds an average savings of \$395, with a standard deviation of \$102.
\begin{parts}
\item Are conditions for inference satisfied?
\item Perform a hypothesis test and state your conclusion.
\item Do you agree with the market researcher that the amount of savings advertised is an overestimate? Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Happy hour} A restaurant owner is considering extending the happy hour at his restaurant since he would like to see if it increases revenue. If it does, he will permanently extend happy hour. He estimates that the current average revenue per customer is \$18 during happy hour. He runs the extended happy hour for a week and finds an average revenue of \$19.25 with a standard deviation \$3.02 based on a simple random sample of 70 customers. \vspace{-1mm}
\begin{parts}
\item Are conditions for inference satisfied?
\item Perform a hypothesis test. Suppose the customers and their buying habits this week were no different than in any other week for this particular bar. (This may not always be a reasonable assumption.)
\item Calculate a 90\% confidence interval for the average revenue per customer.
\item Do your results from the hypothesis test and the confidence interval agree? Explain.
\item If your hypothesis test and confidence interval suggest a significant increase in revenue per customer, why might you still not recommend that the restaurant owner extend the happy hour based on this criterion? What may be a better measure to consider?

\eoce{\qt{Speed reading, Part I} \label{speedReading} A company offering online speed reading courses claims that students who take their courses show a 5 times (500\%) increase in the number of words they can read in a minute without losing comprehension. A random sample of 100 students yielded an average increase of 415\% with a standard deviation of 220\%. Is there evidence that the company's claim is false?
\begin{parts}
\item Are conditions for inference satisfied?
\item Perform a hypothesis test evaluating if the company's claim is reasonable or if the true average improvement is less than 500\%. Make sure to interpret your response in context of the hypothesis test and the data. Use $\alpha = 0.025$.

\eoce{\qt{Spam mail, Part I} \label{spam} The 2004 National Technology Readiness Survey sponsored by the Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland surveyed 418 randomly sampled Americans, asking them how many spam emails they receive per day. The survey was repeated on a new random sample of 499 Americans in 2009.\footfullcite{webpage:spam}
\begin{parts}
\item What are the hypotheses for evaluating if the average spam emails per day has changed from 2004 to 2009.
\item In 2004 the mean was 18.5 spam emails per day, and in 2009 this value was 14.9 emails per day. What is the point estimate for the difference between the two population means?
\item A report on the survey states that the observed difference between the sample means is not statistically significant. Explain what this means in context of the hypothesis test and the data.
\item Would you expect a confidence interval for the difference between the two population means to contain 0? Explain your reasoning.

\begin{parts}
\item If a given value (for example, the null hypothesized value of a parameter) is within a 95\% confidence interval, it will also be within a 99\% confidence interval.
\item Decreasing the significance level ($\alpha$) will increase the probability of making a Type 1 error.
\item Suppose the null hypothesis is $\mu = 5$ and we fail to reject $H_0$. Under this scenario, the true population mean is 5.
\item If the alternative hypothesis is true, then the probability of making a Type 2 error and the power of a test add up to 1.
\item With large sample sizes, even small differences between the null value and the true value of the parameter, a difference often called the effect size\index{effect size}, will be identified as statistically significant.
\item A cutoff of $\alpha$ = 0.05 is the ideal value for all hypothesis tests.
