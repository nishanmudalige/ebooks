\chapter{Inference for numerical data}
\label{inferenceForNumericalData}

Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} introduced a framework for statistical inference based on confidence intervals and hypotheses. In this chapter, we encounter several new point estimates and scenarios. In each case, the inference ideas remain the same:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Determine which point estimate or test statistic is useful.
\item Identify an appropriate distribution for the point estimate or test statistic.
\item Apply the ideas from Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} using the distribution from step 2.
\end{enumerate}
Each section in Chapter~\ref{inferenceForNumericalData} explores a new situation: the difference of two means (\ref{pairedData},~\ref{differenceOfTwoMeans}); a~single mean or difference of means where we relax the minimum sample size condition (\ref{oneSampleMeansWithTDistribution},~\ref{theTDistributionForTheDifferenceOfTwoMeans}); and the comparison of means across multiple groups (\ref{anovaAndRegrWithCategoricalVariables}). Chapter~\ref{inferenceForCategoricalData} will introduce scenarios that highlight categorical data.

%Are textbooks actually cheaper online? Here we compare the price of textbooks at UCLA's bookstore and prices at Amazon.com. Seventy-three UCLA courses were randomly sampled in Spring 2010, representing less than 10\% of all UCLA courses.\footnote{When a class had multiple books, only the most expensive text was considered.} A portion of this data set is shown in Table~\ref{textbooksDF}.

%\subsection{Paired observations and samples}
%
%Each textbook has two corresponding prices in the data set: one for the UCLA bookstore and one for Amazon. Therefore, each textbook price from the UCLA bookstore has a natural correspondence with a textbook price from Amazon. When two sets of observations have this special correspondence, they are said to be \term{paired}.
%
%\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Paired data}
%Two sets of observations are \emph{paired} if each observation in one set has a special correspondence or connection with exactly one observation in the other data set.}
%\end{termBox}
%
%To analyze paired data, it is often useful to look at the difference in outcomes of each pair of observations. In the \data{textbook} data set, we look at the difference in prices, which is represented as the \var{diff} variable in the \data{textbooks} data. Here the differences are taken as
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\text{UCLA price} - \text{Amazon price}
%\end{eqnarray*}
%for each book. It is important that we always subtract using a consistent order; here Amazon prices are always subtracted from UCLA prices. A histogram of these differences is shown in Figure~\ref{diffInTextbookPricesS10}. Using differences between paired observations is a common and useful way to analyze paired data.

%The first difference shown in Table~\ref{textbooksDF} is computed as $27.67-27.95=-0.28$. Verify the differences are calculated correctly for observations 2 and 3.\footnote{Observation 2: $40.59 - 31.14 = 9.45$. Observation 3: $31.68 - 32.00 = -0.32$.}
%\end{exercise}
%
%\subsection{Inference for paired data}
%
%To analyze a paired data set, we use the exact same tools that we developed in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference}. Now we apply them to the differences in the paired observations.

%
%\begin{example}{Set up and implement a hypothesis test to determine whether, on average, there is a difference between Amazon's price for a book and the UCLA bookstore's price.}
%\label{htForDiffInUCLAAndAmazonTextbookPrices}
%There are two scenarios: there is no difference or there is some difference in average prices. The \emph{no difference} scenario is always the null hypothesis:
%\begin{itemize}
%\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
%\item[$H_0$:] $\mu_{diff}=0$. There is no difference in the average textbook price.
%\item[$H_A$:] $\mu_{diff} \neq 0$. There is a difference in average prices.
%\end{itemize}
%Can the normal model be used to describe the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}_{diff}$? We must check that the differences meet the conditions established in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference}. The observations are based on a simple random sample from less than 10\% of all books sold at the bookstore, so independence is reasonable; there are more than 30 differences; and the distribution of differences, shown in Figure~\ref{diffInTextbookPricesS10}, is strongly skewed, but this amount of skew is reasonable for this sized data set ($n=73$). Because all three conditions are reasonably satisfied, we can conclude the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}_{diff}$ is nearly normal and our estimate of the standard error will be reasonable.
%
%We compute the standard error associated with $\bar{x}_{diff}$ using the standard deviation of the differences ($s_{_{diff}}=14.26$) and the number of differences ($n_{_{diff}}=73$):
%$$SE_{\bar{x}_{diff}} = \frac{s_{diff}}{\sqrt{n_{diff}}} = \frac{14.26}{\sqrt{73}} = 1.67$$
%To visualize the p-value, the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}_{diff}$ is drawn as though $H_0$ is true, which is shown in Figure~\ref{textbooksS10HTTails}. The p-value is represented by the two (very) small tails.

%\caption{Sampling distribution for the mean difference in book prices, if the true average difference is zero.}
%\label{textbooksS10HTTails}
%\end{figure}
%
%To find the tail areas, we compute the test statistic, which is the Z score of $\bar{x}_{diff}$ under the null condition that the actual mean difference is 0:
%$$Z = \frac{\bar{x}_{diff} - 0}{SE_{x_{diff}}} = \frac{12.76 - 0}{1.67} = 7.59$$
%This Z score is so large it isn't even in the table, which ensures the single tail area will be 0.0002 or smaller. Since the p-value corresponds to both tails in this case and the normal distribution is symmetric, the p-value can be estimated as twice the one-tail area:
%$$\text{p-value} = 2\times (\text{one tail area}) \approx 2\times 0.0002 = 0.0004$$
%Because the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We have found convincing evidence that Amazon is, on average, cheaper than the UCLA bookstore for UCLA course textbooks.
%\end{example}
%
%\begin{exercise}
%Create a 95\% confidence interval for the average price difference between books at the UCLA bookstore and books on Amazon.\footnote{Conditions have already verified and the standard error computed in Example~\ref{htForDiffInUCLAAndAmazonTextbookPrices}. To find the interval, identify $z^{\star}$ (1.96 for 95\% confidence) and plug it, the point estimate, and the standard error into the confidence interval formula:
%$$\text{point estimate} \ \pm\ z^{\star}SE \quad\to\quad 12.76 \ \pm\ 1.96\times 1.67 \quad\to\quad (9.49, 16.03)$$
%We are 95\% confident that Amazon is, on average, between \$9.49 and \$16.03 cheaper than the UCLA bookstore for UCLA course books.}

%\section{Difference of two means}
%\label{differenceOfTwoMeans}
%
%In this section we consider a difference in two population means, $\mu_1 - \mu_2$, under the condition that the data are not paired. The methods are similar in theory but different in the details. Just as with a single sample, we identify conditions to ensure a point estimate of the difference $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ is nearly normal. Next we introduce a formula for the standard error, which allows us to apply our general tools from Section~\ref{aFrameworkForInference}.
%
%We apply these methods to two examples: participants in the 2012 Cherry Blossom Run and newborn infants. This section is motivated by questions like ``Is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke?''
%
%\subsection{Point estimates and standard errors for differences of means}
%
%\index{data!run10Samp|(}
%
%\index{point estimate!difference of means|(}
%
%We would like to estimate the average difference in run times for men and women using the \data{run10Samp} data set, which was a simple random sample of 45 men and 55 women from all runners in the 2012 Cherry Blossom Run. Table~\ref{cherryBlossomRun2009SampleOf180SummaryStats} presents relevant summary statistics, and box plots of each sample are shown in Figure~\ref{cbrRunTimesMenWomen}.

%\end{figure}
%
%The two samples are independent of one-another, so the data are not paired. Instead a point estimate of the difference in average 10 mile times for men and women, $\mu_w - \mu_m$, can be found using the two sample means:
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\bar{x}_{w} - \bar{x}_{m}\ =\ 102.13 - 87.65\ =\ 14.48
%\end{eqnarray*}
%Because we are examining two simple random samples from less than 10\% of the population, each sample contains at least 30 observations, and neither distribution is strongly skewed, we can safely conclude the sampling distribution of each sample mean is nearly normal. Finally, because each sample is independent of the other (e.g. the data are not paired), we can conclude that the difference in sample means can be modeled using a normal distribution.\footnote{Probability theory guarantees that the difference of two independent normal random variables is also normal. Because each sample mean is nearly normal and observations in the samples are independent, we are assured the difference is also nearly normal.}
%
%\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Conditions for normality of $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$}
%If the sample means, $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$, each meet the criteria for having nearly normal sampling distributions and the observations in the two samples are independent, then the difference in sample means, $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$, will have a sampling distribution that is nearly normal.}
%\end{termBox}
%
%We can quantify the variability in the point estimate, $\bar{x}_{w} - \bar{x}_{m}$, using the following formula for its standard error:
%\index{standard error!difference in means}
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%SE_{\bar{x}_{w} - \bar{x}_{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{w}^2}{n_{w}} + \frac{\sigma_{m}^2}{n_{m}}}
%\end{eqnarray*}
%We usually estimate this standard error using standard deviation estimates  based on the samples:
%\begin{align*}
%SE_{\bar{x}_{w} - \bar{x}_{m}}
%	&= \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{w}^2}{n_{w}} + \frac{\sigma_{m}^2}{n_{m}}} \\
%	&\approx \sqrt{\frac{s_{w}^2}{n_{w}} + \frac{s_{m}^2}{n_{m}}}
%	= \sqrt{\frac{15.2^2}{55} + \frac{12.5^2}{45}} = 2.77
%\end{align*}
%Because each sample has at least 30 observations ($n_{w} = 55$ and $n_{m} = 45$), this substitution using the sample standard deviation tends to be very good.
%
%\index{point estimate!difference of means|)}
%
%\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Distribution of a difference of sample means}
%The sample difference of two means, $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$, is nearly normal with mean $\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}$ and estimated standard error
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\textstyle
%SE_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
%\label{seOfDifferenceInMeans}
%\end{eqnarray}
%when each sample mean is nearly normal and all observations are independent.}
%\end{termBox}
%
%\subsection{Confidence interval for the difference}
%
%When the data indicate that the point estimate $\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}$ comes from a nearly normal distribution, we can construct a confidence interval for the difference in two means from the framework built in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference}. Here a point estimate, $\bar{x}_{w} - \bar{x}_{m} = 14.48$, is associated with a normal model with standard error $SE=2.77$. Using this information, the general confidence interval formula may be applied in an attempt to capture the true difference in means, in this case using a 95\% confidence level:
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\text{point estimate}\  \pm \ z^{\star}SE \quad\to\quad 14.48\  \pm \ 1.96\times 2.77 \quad\to\quad (9.05, 19.91)
%\end{eqnarray*}
%Based on the samples, we are 95\% confident that men ran, on average, between 9.05 and 19.91 minutes faster than women in the 2012 Cherry Blossom Run.
%
%\begin{exercise}
%What does 95\% confidence mean?\footnote{If we were to collected many such samples and create 95\% confidence intervals for each, then about 95\% of these intervals would contain the population difference, $\mu_w - \mu_m$.}
%\end{exercise}
%
%\begin{exercise}
%We may be interested in a different confidence level. Construct the 99\% confidence interval for the population difference in average run times based on the sample data.\footnote{The only thing that changes is $z^{\star}$: we use $z^{\star}=2.58$ for a 99\% confidence level. (If the selection of $z^{\star}$ is confusing, see Section~\ref{changingTheConfidenceLevelSection} for an explanation.) The 99\% confidence interval: $14.48\ \pm\ 2.58\times 2.77 \to(7.33, 21.63)$. We are 99\% confident that the true difference in the average run times between men and women is between 7.33 and 21.63 minutes.}

\subsection{Hypothesis tests based on a difference in means}

\index{data!baby\_smoke|(}

A data set called \data{baby\_\hspace{0.3mm}smoke} represents a random sample of 150 cases of mothers and their newborns in North Carolina over a year. Four cases from this data set are represented in Table~\ref{babySmokeDF}. We are particularly interested in two variables: \var{weight} and \var{smoke}. The \var{weight} variable represents the weights of the newborns and the \var{smoke} variable describes which mothers smoked during pregnancy. We would like to know, is convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke? We will use the North Carolina sample to try to answer this question. The smoking group includes 50 cases and the nonsmoking group contains 100 cases, represented in Figure~\ref{babySmokePlotOfTwoGroupsToExamineSkew}.

\begin{table}

\end{figure}

\textB{\pagebreak}

\begin{example}{Set up appropriate hypotheses to evaluate whether there is a relationship between a mother smoking and average birth weight.}\label{babySmokeHTForWeight}
The null hypothesis represents the case of no difference between the groups.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] There is no difference in average birth weight for newborns from mothers who did and did not smoke. In statistical notation: $\mu_{n} - \mu_{s} = 0$, where $\mu_{n}$ represents non-smoking mothers and $\mu_s$ represents mothers who smoked.
\item[$H_A$:] There is some difference in average newborn weights from mothers who did and did not smoke ($\mu_{n} - \mu_{s} \neq 0$).
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

Summary statistics are shown for each sample in Table~\ref{summaryStatsOfBirthWeightForNewbornsFromSmokingAndNonsmokingMothers}. Because the data come from a simple random sample and consist of less than 10\% of all such cases, the observations are independent. Additionally, each group's sample size is at least 30 and the skew in each sample distribution is strong (see Figure~\ref{babySmokePlotOfTwoGroupsToExamineSkew}). The skew is reasonable for these sample sizes of 50 and 100. Therefore, each sample mean is associated with a nearly normal distribution.

(a)~What is the point estimate of the population difference, $\mu_{n} - \mu_{s}$? (b)~Can we use a normal distribution to model this difference? (c)~Compute the standard error of the point estimate from part (a).\footnote{(a)~The difference in sample means is an appropriate point estimate: $\bar{x}_{n} - \bar{x}_{s} = 0.40$. (b)~Because the samples are independent and each sample mean is nearly normal, their difference is also nearly normal. (c)~The standard error of the estimate can be estimated using Equation~(\ref{seOfDifferenceInMeans}):
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_n^2}{n_n} + \frac{\sigma_s^2}{n_s}}
	\approx \sqrt{\frac{s_n^2}{n_n} + \frac{s_s^2}{n_s}}
	= \sqrt{\frac{1.60^2}{100} + \frac{1.43^2}{50}}
	= 0.26
\end{eqnarray*}
The standard error estimate should be sufficiently accurate since the conditions were reasonably satisfied.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{If the null hypothesis from Example~\ref{babySmokeHTForWeight} was true, what would be the expected value of the point estimate? And the standard deviation associated with this estimate? Draw a picture to represent the p-value.} \label{pictureOfPValueForEstimateOfDiffOfMeansOfBirthWeights}
If the null hypothesis was true, then we expect to see a difference near 0. The standard error corresponds to the standard deviation of the point estimate: 0.26. To depict the p-value, we draw the distribution of the point estimate as though $H_0$ was true and shade areas representing at least as much evidence against $H_0$ as what was observed. Both tails are shaded because it is a two-sided test.
\begin{center}

\begin{example}{Compute the p-value of the hypothesis test using the figure in Example~\ref{pictureOfPValueForEstimateOfDiffOfMeansOfBirthWeights}, and evaluate the hypotheses using a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$.} \label{babySmokeHTForWeightComputePValueAndEvalHT}
Since the point estimate is nearly normal, we can find the upper tail using the Z score and normal probability table:
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{\ 0.40 - 0\ }{0.26} = 1.54 \quad \to \quad \text{upper tail } = 1 - 0.938 = 0.062
\end{eqnarray*}
Because this is a two-sided test and we want the area of both tails, we double this single tail to get the p-value: 0.124. This p-value is larger than the significance value, 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to say there is a difference in average birth weight of newborns from North Carolina mothers who did smoke during pregnancy and newborns from North Carolina mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Does the conclusion to Example~\ref{babySmokeHTForWeightComputePValueAndEvalHT} mean that smoking and average birth weight are unrelated?\footnote{Absolutely not. It is possible that there is some difference but we did not detect it. If this is the case, we made a Type 2 Error.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{babySmokeHTIDingHowToDetectDifferences}
If we made a Type 2 Error and there is a difference, what could we have done differently in data collection to be more likely to detect such a difference?\footnote{We could have collected more data. If the sample sizes are larger, we tend to have a better shot at finding a difference if one exists.}

\subsection{Summary for inference of the difference of two means}

When considering the difference of two means, there are two common cases: the two samples are paired or they are independent. (There are instances where the data are neither paired nor independent.) The paired case was treated in Section~\ref{pairedData}, where the one-sample methods were applied to the differences from the paired observations. We examined the second and more complex scenario in this section.

When applying the normal model to the point estimate $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ (corresponding to unpaired data), it is important to verify conditions before applying the inference framework using the normal model. First, each sample mean must meet the conditions for normality; these conditions are described in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} on page~\pageref{terBoxOfCondForXBarBeingNearlyNormalAndSEBeingAccurate}. Secondly, the samples must be collected independently (e.g. not paired data). When these conditions are satisfied, the general inference tools of Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} may be applied.

For example, a confidence interval may take the following form:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{point estimate}\ \pm\ z^{\star} SE
\end{eqnarray*}
When we compute the confidence interval for $\mu_1 - \mu_2$, the point estimate is the difference in sample means, the value $z^{\star}$ corresponds to the confidence level, and the standard error is computed from Equation~\eqref{seOfDifferenceInMeans} on page~\pageref{seOfDifferenceInMeans}. While the point estimate and standard error formulas change a little, the framework for a confidence interval stays the same. This is also true in hypothesis tests for differences of means.

In a hypothesis test, we apply the standard framework and use the specific formulas for the point estimate and standard error of a difference in two means. The test statistic represented by the Z score may be computed as
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{\ \text{point estimate} - \text{null value}\ }{SE}
\end{eqnarray*}
When assessing the difference in two means, the point estimate takes the form $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$, and the standard error again takes the form of Equation~\eqref{seOfDifferenceInMeans} on page~\pageref{seOfDifferenceInMeans}. Finally, the null value is the difference in sample means under the null hypothesis. Just as in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference}, the test statistic $Z$ is used to identify the p-value.

\subsection{Examining the standard error formula}

The formula for the standard error of the difference in two means is similar to the formula for other standard errors. Recall that the standard error of a single mean, $\bar{x}_1$, can be approximated by
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE_{\bar{x}_1} = \frac{s_1}{\ \sqrt{n_1}\ }
\end{eqnarray*}
where $s_1$ and $n_1$ represent the sample standard deviation and sample size.

The standard error of the difference of two sample means can be constructed from the standard errors of the separate sample means:
\begin{eqnarray}
SE_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}}
	= \sqrt{SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2}
	= \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{{n_1}} + \frac{s_2^2}{{n_2}}}
\label{seOfDiffOfMeansInTermsOfSEOfIndividualMeans}
\end{eqnarray}
This special relationship follows from probability theory.

\begin{exercise}\label{derivingSEForDiffOfTwoMeansExercise}
Prerequisite: Section~\ref{randomVariablesSection}.
We can rewrite Equation~(\ref{seOfDiffOfMeansInTermsOfSEOfIndividualMeans}) in a different way:
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}}^2 = SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2
\end{eqnarray*}
Explain where this formula comes from using the ideas of probability theory.\footnote{The standard error squared represents the variance of the estimate. If $X$ and $Y$ are two random variables with variances $\sigma_x^2$ and $\sigma_y^2$, then the variance of $X-Y$ is $\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2$. Likewise, the variance corresponding to $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ is $\sigma_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + \sigma_{\bar{x}_2}^2$. Because $\sigma_{\bar{x}_1}^2$ and $\sigma_{\bar{x}_2}^2$ are just another way of writing $SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2$ and  $SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2$, the variance associated with $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ may be written as $SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2$.}

The motivation in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} for requiring a large sample was two-fold. First, a large sample ensures that the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is nearly normal. We will see in Section~\ref{normalityCond} that if the population data are nearly normal, then $\bar{x}$ is also nearly normal regardless of the sample size. The second motivation for a large sample was that we get a better estimate of the standard error when using a large sample. The standard error estimate will not generally be accurate for smaller sample sizes, and this motivates the introduction of the $t$ distribution, which we introduce in Section~\ref{introducingTheTDistribution}.

We will see that the $t$ distribution is a helpful substitute for the normal distribution when we model a sample mean $\bar{x}$ that comes from a small sample. While we emphasize the use of the $t$ distribution for small samples, this distribution may also be used for means from large samples.

\subsection{The normality condition}
\label{normalityCond}

We use a special case of the Central Limit Theorem to ensure the distribution of the sample means will be nearly normal, regardless of sample size, provided the data come from a nearly normal distribution.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Central Limit Theorem for normal data}
The sampling distribution of the mean is nearly normal when the sample observations are independent and come from a nearly normal distribution. This is true for any sample size.
\index{Central Limit Theorem!normal data|)}}
\end{termBox}

While this seems like a very helpful special case, there is one small problem. It is inherently difficult to verify normality in small data sets.

\begin{caution}
{Checking the normality condition}
{We should exercise caution when verifying the normality condition for small samples. It is important to not only examine the data but also think about where the data come from. For example, ask: would I expect this distribution to be symmetric, and am I confident that outliers are rare?}
\end{caution}

You may relax the normality condition as the sample size goes up. If the sample size is~10 or more, slight skew is not problematic. Once the sample size hits about~30, then moderate skew is reasonable. Data with strong skew or outliers require a more cautious analysis.


%\subsection{Introducing the $t$ distribution}
%\label{introducingTheTDistribution}
%
%\index{$t$ distribution|(}
%
%The second reason we previously required a large sample size was so that we could accurately estimate the standard error using the sample data. In the cases where we will use a small sample to calculate the standard error, it will be useful to rely on a new distribution for inference calculations: the $t$ distribution. A $t$ distribution, shown as a solid line in Figure~\ref{tDistCompareToNormalDist}, has a bell shape. However, its tails are thicker than the normal model's. This means observations are more likely to fall beyond two standard deviations from the mean than under the normal distribution.\footnote{The standard deviation of the $t$ distribution is actually a little more than 1. However, it is useful to always think of the $t$ distribution as having a standard deviation of 1 in all of our applications.} These extra thick tails are exactly the correction we need to resolve the problem of a poorly estimated standard error.

%\caption{Comparison of a $t$ distribution (solid line) and a normal distribution (dotted line).}
%\label{tDistCompareToNormalDist}
%\end{figure}
%
%The $t$ distribution, always centered at zero, has a single parameter: degrees of freedom. The \termsub{degrees of freedom (df)}{degrees of freedom (df)!$t$ distribution} describe the precise form of the bell-shaped $t$ distribution. Several $t$ distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{tDistConvergeToNormalDist}. When there are more degrees of freedom, the $t$~distribution looks very much like the standard normal distribution.
%
%\begin{figure}

%\label{tDistConvergeToNormalDist}
%\end{figure}
%
%\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Degrees of freedom (df)}
%The degrees of freedom describe the shape of the $t$ distribution. The larger the degrees of freedom, the more closely the distribution approximates the normal model.}
%\end{termBox}
%
%When the degrees of freedom is about 30 or more, the $t$ distribution is nearly indistinguishable from the normal distribution. In Section~\ref{tDistSolutionToSEProblem}, we relate degrees of freedom to sample size.
%
%We will find it very useful to become familiar with the $t$ distribution, because it plays a very similar role to the normal distribution during inference for small samples of numerical data. We use a \term{t table}, partially shown in Table~\ref{tTableSample}, in place of the normal probability table for small sample numerical data. A larger table is presented in Appendix~\vref{tDistributionTable}.

%
%Each row in the $t$ table represents a $t$ distribution with different degrees of freedom. The columns correspond to tail probabilities. For instance, if we know we are working with the $t$ distribution with $df=18$, we can examine row 18, which is \highlightO{highlighted} in Table~\ref{tTableSample}. If we want the value in this row that identifies the cutoff for an upper tail of 10\%, we can look in the column where \emph{one tail} is 0.100. This cutoff is 1.33. If we had wanted the cutoff for the lower 10\%, we would use -1.33. Just like the normal distribution, all $t$ distributions are symmetric.
%
%\begin{example}{What proportion of the $t$ distribution with 18 degrees of freedom falls below -2.10?}
%Just like a normal probability problem, we first draw the picture in Figure~\ref{tDistDF18LeftTail2Point10} and shade the area below -2.10. To find this area, we identify the appropriate row: $df=18$. Then we identify the column containing the absolute value of -2.10; it is the third column. Because we are looking for just one tail, we examine the top line of the table, which shows that a one tail area for a value in the third row corresponds to 0.025. About 2.5\% of the distribution falls below -2.10. In the next example we encounter a case where the exact $t$ value is not listed in the table.

We identify the one tail area of the first and second columns, 0.050 and 0.10, and we conclude that between 5\% and 10\% of the distribution is more than 1.65 standard deviations above the mean.

\subsection{The $t$ distribution as a solution to the standard error problem}
\label{tDistSolutionToSEProblem}

When estimating the mean and standard error from a small sample, the $t$ distribution is a more accurate tool than the normal model. This is true for both small and large samples.

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{When to use the $t$ distribution}
Use the $t$ distribution for inference of the sample mean when observations are independent and nearly normal. You may relax the nearly normal condition as the sample size increases. For example, the data distribution may be moderately skewed when the sample size is at least~30.
}
\end{tipBox}

\index{data!dolphins and mercury|(}

To proceed with the $t$ distribution for inference about a single mean, we must check two conditions.
\begin{description}
\item[Independence of observations.] We verify this condition just as we did before. We collect a simple random sample from less than 10\% of the population, or if it was an experiment or random process, we carefully check to the best of our abilities that the observations were independent.
\item[Observations come from a nearly normal distribution.] This second condition is difficult to verify with small data sets. We often (i) take a look at a plot of the data for obvious departures from the normal model, and (ii) consider whether any previous experiences alert us that the data may not be nearly normal.
\end{description}
When examining a sample mean and estimated standard error from a sample of $n$ independent and nearly normal observations, we use a $t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom~($df$). For example, if the sample size was 19, then we would use the $t$ distribution with $df=19-1=18$ degrees of freedom and proceed exactly as we did in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference}, except that \emph{now we use the $t$ table}.









%\subsection{One sample $t$ confidence intervals}
%\label{oneSampleTConfidenceIntervals}
%
%Dolphins are at the top of the oceanic food chain, which causes dangerous substances such as mercury to concentrate in their organs and muscles. This is an important problem for both dolphins and other animals, like humans, who occasionally eat them. For instance, this is particularly relevant in Japan where school meals have included dolphin at times.

%Here we identify a confidence interval for the average mercury content in dolphin muscle using a sample of 19 Risso's dolphins from the Taiji area in Japan.\footnote{Taiji was featured in the movie \emph{The Cove}, and it is a significant source of dolphin and whale meat in Japan. Thousands of dolphins pass through the Taiji area annually, and we will assume these 19 dolphins represent a simple random sample from those dolphins. Data reference: Endo T and Haraguchi K. 2009. High mercury levels in hair samples from residents of Taiji, a Japanese whaling town. Marine Pollution Bulletin 60(5):743-747.} The data are summarized in Table~\ref{summaryStatsOfHgInMuscleOfRissosDolphins}. The minimum and maximum observed values can be used to evaluate whether or not there are obvious outliers or skew.

%\end{table}
%
%\begin{example}{Are the independence and normality conditions satisfied for this data~set?}
%The observations are a simple random sample and consist of less than 10\% of the population, therefore independence is reasonable. The summary statistics in Table~\ref{summaryStatsOfHgInMuscleOfRissosDolphins} do not suggest any skew or outliers; all observations are within 2.5 standard deviations of the mean. Based on this evidence, the normality assumption seems reasonable.
%\end{example}
%
%In the normal model, we used $z^{\star}$ and the standard error to determine the width of a confidence interval. We revise the confidence interval formula slightly when using the $t$ distribution:
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\bar{x} \ \pm\  t^{\star}_{df}SE
%\end{eqnarray*}
%\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-9mm}

%$t^{\star}_{df}$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Multiplication\\factor for\\$t$ conf. interval}The sample mean and estimated standard error are computed just as before ($\bar{x} = 4.4$ and $SE = s/\sqrt{n} = 0.528$). The value $t^{\star}_{df}$ is a cutoff we obtain based on the confidence level and the $t$ distribution with $df$ degrees of freedom. Before determining this cutoff, we will first need the degrees of freedom.
%
%\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Degrees of freedom for a single sample}
%If the sample has $n$ observations and we are examining a single mean, then we use the $t$ distribution with $df=n-1$ degrees of freedom.}
%\end{termBox}
%
%In our current example, we should use the $t$ distribution with $df=19-1=18$ degrees of freedom. Then identifying $t_{18}^{\star}$ is similar to how we found $z^{\star}$. 
%\begin{itemize}
%\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
%\item For a 95\% confidence interval, we want to find the cutoff $t^{\star}_{18}$ such that 95\% of the $t$ distribution is between -$t^{\star}_{18}$ and $t^{\star}_{18}$.
%\item We look in the $t$ table on page~\pageref{tTableSample}, find the column with area totaling 0.05 in the two tails (third column), and then the row with 18 degrees of freedom: $t^{\star}_{18} = 2.10$.
%\end{itemize}
%Generally the value of $t^{\star}_{df}$ is slightly larger than what we would get under the normal model with~$z^{\star}$.
%
%
%
%Finally, we can substitute all our values into the confidence interval equation to create the 95\% confidence interval for the average mercury content in muscles from Risso's dolphins that pass through the Taiji area:
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\bar{x} \ \pm\  t^{\star}_{18}SE
%	\quad \to \quad
%4.4 \ \pm\  2.10 \times 0.528
%	\quad \to \quad

%\end{eqnarray*}
%We are 95\% confident the average mercury content of muscles in Risso's dolphins is between 3.29 and 5.51 $\mu$g/wet gram. This is above the Japanese regulation level of 0.4 $\mu$g/wet gram.

\subsection{One sample $t$ tests}
\label{oneSampleTTests}

\index{data!SAT prep company|(}

An SAT preparation company claims that its students' scores improve by over 100 points on average after their course. A consumer group would like to evaluate this claim, and they collect data on a random sample of 30 students who took the class. Each of these students took the SAT before and after taking the company's course, and so we have a difference in scores for each student. We will examine these differences $x_1=57$, $x_2=133$, ..., $x_{30}=140$ as a sample to evaluate the company's claim. 
(This is \emph{paired data}, so we analyze the score differences; for a review of the ideas of paired data, see Section~\ref{pairedData}.) 
The distribution of the differences, shown in Figure~\ref{satImprovementHTDataHistogram}, has mean 135.9 and standard deviation 82.2. Do these data provide convincing evidence to back up the company's claim? 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.54\textwidth]{05/figures/satImprovementHTDataHistogram/satImprovementHTDataHistogram}
\caption{Sample distribution of improvements in SAT scores after taking the SAT course. The distribution is approximately symmetric.}
\label{satImprovementHTDataHistogram}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
Set up hypotheses to evaluate the company's claim. Use $\mu_{_{diff}}$ to represent the true average difference in student scores.\footnote{This is a one-sided test. $H_0$: student scores do not improve by more than 100 after taking the company's course. $\mu_{_{diff}} = 100$ (we always write the null hypothesis with an equality). $H_A$: students scores improve by more than 100 points on average after taking the company's course. $\mu_{_{diff}} > 100$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Are the conditions to use the $t$ distribution method satisfied?\footnote{This is a random sample from less than 10\% of the company's students (assuming they have more than 300 former students), so the independence condition is reasonable. The normality condition also seems reasonable based on Figure~\ref{satImprovementHTDataHistogram}. We can use the $t$ distribution method. Note that we could use the normal distribution. However, since the sample size ($n=30$) just meets the threshold for reasonably estimating the standard error, it is advisable to use the $t$ distribution.}
\end{exercise}

Just as we did for the normal case, we standardize the sample mean using the Z score to identify the test statistic. However, we will write $T$\index{T score ($T$)|textbf}\marginpar[\raggedright$T$\vspace{0.5mm}\\\footnotesize T score\\(like Z score)]{\raggedright$T$\vspace{0.5mm}\\\footnotesize T score\\(like Z score)} instead of $Z$, because we have a small sample and are basing our inference on the $t$ distribution:
\begin{eqnarray*}
T = \frac{\bar{x} - \text{null value}}{SE} = \frac{135.9 - 100}{82.2/\sqrt{30}} = 2.39
\end{eqnarray*}
If the null hypothesis was true, the test statistic $T$ would follow a $t$ distribution with $df = n-1 = 29$ degrees of freedom. We can draw a picture of this distribution and mark the observed $T$, as in Figure~\ref{pValueShownForSATHTOfOver100PtGain}. The shaded right tail represents the p-value: the probability of observing such strong evidence in favor of the SAT company's claim, if the average student improvement is really only 100.

\end{figure}

\textB{\pagebreak}

\begin{exercise}
Use the $t$ table in Appendix~\vref{tDistributionTable} to identify the p-value. What do you conclude?\footnote{We use the row with 29 degrees of freedom. The value $T=2.39$ falls between the third and fourth columns. Because we are looking for a single tail, this corresponds to a p-value between 0.01 and 0.025. The p-value is guaranteed to be less than 0.05 (the default significance level), so we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide convincing evidence to support the company's claim that student scores improve by more than 100 points following the class.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Because we rejected the null hypothesis, does this mean that taking the company's class improves student scores by more than 100 points on average?\footnote{This is an observational study, so we cannot make this causal conclusion. For instance, maybe SAT test takers tend to improve their score over time even if they don't take a special SAT class, or perhaps only the most motivated students take such SAT courses.}

\section{The $t$ distribution for the difference of two means}
\label{theTDistributionForTheDifferenceOfTwoMeans}

It is also useful to be able to compare two means for small samples. For instance, a teacher might like to test the notion that two versions of an exam were equally difficult. She could do so by randomly assigning each version to students. If she found that the average scores on the exams were so different that we cannot write it off as chance, then she may want to award extra points to students who took the more difficult exam.

In a medical context, we might investigate whether embryonic stem cells can improve heart pumping capacity in individuals who have suffered a heart attack. We could look for evidence of greater heart health in the stem cell group against a control group.

In this section we use the $t$ distribution for the difference in sample means. We will again drop the minimum sample size condition and instead impose a strong condition on the distribution of the data.


\subsection{Sampling distributions for the difference in two means}

In the example of two exam versions, the teacher would like to evaluate whether there is convincing evidence that the difference in average scores between the two exams is not due to chance.

It will be useful to extend the $t$ distribution method from Section~\ref{oneSampleMeansWithTDistribution} to apply to a difference of means:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2
	\qquad \text{as a point estimate for} \qquad
	\mu_1 - \mu_2
\end{eqnarray*}
Our procedure for checking conditions mirrors what we did for large samples in Section~\ref{differenceOfTwoMeans}. First, we verify the small sample conditions (independence and nearly normal data) for each sample separately, then we verify that the samples are also independent. For instance, if the teacher believes students in her class are independent, the exam scores are nearly normal, and the students taking each version of the exam were independent, then we can use the $t$ distribution for inference on the point estimate $\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}$.

The formula for the standard error of $\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}$, introduced in Section~\ref{differenceOfTwoMeans},
also applies to small samples:
\begin{eqnarray}
SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}
	= \sqrt{SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2}
	 = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} \label{seOfDiffOfTwoMeansInTDistSection}
\end{eqnarray}
Because we will use the $t$ distribution, we will need to identify the appropriate degrees of freedom. This can be done using computer software. An alternative technique is to use the smaller of $n_1 - 1$ and $n_2 - 1$, which is the method we will apply in the examples and exercises.\footnote{This technique for degrees of freedom is conservative with respect to a Type 1 Error; it is more difficult to reject the null hypothesis using this $df$ method.}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Using the $t$ distribution for a difference in means}
The $t$ distribution can be used for inference when working with the standardized difference of two means if (1) each sample meets the conditions for using the $t$ distribution and (2) the samples are independent. We estimate the standard error of the difference of two means using Equation~(\ref{seOfDiffOfTwoMeansInTDistSection}).}
\end{termBox}

\subsection{Two sample $t$ test}
%Do not include the test with pooled standard deviations are grouped but mention it as one method that is discussed in other books. The reason: this is a poor test. If the sd's are remotely similar then the result will be basically the same as the sd's are not assumed to be the same. It is a big assumption that can cause problems with almost no benefits.

\index{data!two exam comparison|(}

Summary statistics for each exam version are shown in Table~\ref{summaryStatsForTwoVersionsOfExams}. The teacher would like to evaluate whether this difference is so large that it provides convincing evidence that Version B was more difficult (on average) than Version A.

\begin{exercise} \label{htSetupForEvaluatingTwoExamVersions}
Construct a two-sided hypothesis test to evaluate whether the observed difference in sample means, $\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B=5.3$, might be due to chance.\footnote{Because the teacher did not expect one exam to be more difficult prior to examining the test results, she should use a two-sided hypothesis test. $H_0$: the exams are equally difficult, on average. $\mu_A - \mu_B = 0$. $H_A$: one exam was more difficult than the other, on average. $\mu_A - \mu_B \neq 0$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{conditionsForTDistForEvaluatingTwoExamVersions}
To evaluate the hypotheses in Exercise~\ref{htSetupForEvaluatingTwoExamVersions} using the $t$ distribution, we must first verify assumptions. (a) Does it seem reasonable that the scores are independent within each group? (b) What about the normality condition for each group? (c) Do you think scores from the two groups would be independent of each other (i.e. the two samples are independent)?\footnote{(a) It is probably reasonable to conclude the scores are independent. (b) The summary statistics suggest the data are roughly symmetric about the mean, and it doesn't seem unreasonable to suggest the data might be normal. Note that since these samples are each nearing 30, moderate skew in the data would be acceptable. (c) It seems reasonable to suppose that the samples are independent since the exams were handed out randomly.}
\end{exercise}

After verifying the conditions for each sample and confirming the samples are independent of each other, we are ready to conduct the test using the $t$ distribution. In this case, we are estimating the true difference in average test scores using the sample data, so the point estimate is $\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B = 5.3$. The standard error of the estimate can be calculated using Equation~(\ref{seOfDiffOfTwoMeansInTDistSection}):
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE = \sqrt{\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}} = \sqrt{\frac{14^2}{30} + \frac{20^2}{27}} = 4.62
\end{eqnarray*}
Finally, we construct the test statistic:
\begin{eqnarray*}
T = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE} = \frac{(79.4-74.1) - 0}{4.62} = 1.15
\end{eqnarray*}
If we have a computer handy, we can identify the degrees of freedom as 45.97. Otherwise we use the smaller of $n_1-1$ and $n_2-1$: $df=26$.

Because this value is smaller than the value in the left column, the p-value is larger than 0.200 (two tails!). Because the p-value is so large, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data do not convincingly show that one exam version is more difficult than the other, and the teacher should not be convinced that she should add points to the Version B exam scores.}

In Exercise~\ref{computeTwoTailAreaOfExamVersionsWhereDFIs26}, we could have used $df=45.97$. However, this value is not listed in the table. In such cases, we use the next lower degrees of freedom (unless the computer also provides the p-value). For example, we could have used $df=45$ but not $df=46$. 

\index{data!stem cells, heart function|(}

\begin{exercise} \label{exerciseToEvaluteWhetherESCsAreHelpfulInImprovingHeartFunctionInSheep}
Do embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack? Table~\ref{summaryStatsForSheepHeartDataWhoReceivedMiceESCs} contains summary statistics for an experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack. Each of these sheep was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity was measured. A positive value generally corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which suggests a stronger recovery. 

(a) Set up hypotheses that will be used to test whether there is convincing evidence that ESCs actually increase the amount of blood the heart pumps. (b)~Check conditions for using the $t$ distribution for inference with the point estimate $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$. To assist in this assessment, the data are presented in Figure~\ref{stemCellTherapyForHearts}.\footnote{(a) We first setup the hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] The stem cells do not improve heart pumping function. $\mu_{esc} - \mu_{control} = 0$.
\item[$H_A$:] The stem cells do improve heart pumping function. $\mu_{esc} - \mu_{control} > 0$.
\end{itemize}
(b) Because the sheep were randomly assigned their treatment and, presumably, were kept separate from one another, the independence assumption is reasonable for each sample as well as for between samples. The data are very limited, so we can only check for obvious outliers in the raw data in Figure~\ref{stemCellTherapyForHearts}. Since the distributions are (very) roughly symmetric, we will assume the normality condition is acceptable. Because the conditions are satisfied, we can apply the $t$ distribution.}
\end{exercise}

\label{stemCellTherapyForHearts}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{Use the data from Table~\ref{summaryStatsForSheepHeartDataWhoReceivedMiceESCs} and $df=8$ to evaluate the hypotheses for the ESC experiment described in Exercise~\ref{exerciseToEvaluteWhetherESCsAreHelpfulInImprovingHeartFunctionInSheep}.}
First, we compute the sample difference and the standard error for that point estimate:
\begin{align*}
& \bar{x}_{esc} - \bar{x}_{control} = 7.83 \\
& SE = \sqrt{\frac{5.17^2}{9} + \frac{2.76^2}{9}} = 1.95
\end{align*}
The p-value is depicted as the shaded slim right tail in Figure~\ref{stemCellTherapyForHeartsPValue}, and the test statistic is computed as follows:
$$T = \frac{7.83 - 0}{1.95} = 4.02$$
We use the smaller of $n_1-1$ and $n_2-1$ (each are the same) for the degrees of freedom: $df=8$. Finally, we look for $T=4.02$ in the $t$ table; it falls to the right of the last column, so the p-value is smaller than 0.005 (one tail!). Because the p-value is less than 0.005 and therefore also smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide convincing evidence that embryonic stem cells improve the heart's pumping function in sheep that have suffered a heart attack.
\end{example}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Two sample $t$ confidence interval}

The results from the previous section provided evidence that ESCs actually help improve the pumping function of the heart. But how large is this improvement? To answer this question, we can use a confidence interval. 

\begin{exercise}
In Exercise~\ref{exerciseToEvaluteWhetherESCsAreHelpfulInImprovingHeartFunctionInSheep}, you found that the point estimate, $\bar{x}_{esc} - \bar{x}_{control} = 7.83$, has a standard error of 1.95. Using $df=8$, create a 99\% confidence interval for the improvement due to ESCs.\footnote{We know the point estimate, 7.83, and the standard error, 1.95. We also verified the conditions for using the $t$ distribution in Exercise~\ref{exerciseToEvaluteWhetherESCsAreHelpfulInImprovingHeartFunctionInSheep}. Thus, we only need identify $t^{\star}_8$ to create a 99\% confidence interval: $t^{\star}_{8} = 3.36$. The 99\% confidence interval for the improvement from ESCs is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{point estimate}\ \pm\ t_{8}^{\star}SE
	\quad\to\quad 7.83\ \pm\ 3.36\times 1.95
	\quad\to\quad (1.33, 14.43)
\end{eqnarray*}
That is, we are 99\% confident that the true improvement in heart pumping function is somewhere between 1.33\% and 14.43\%.}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Pooled standard deviation estimate (special topic)}
\label{pooledStandardDeviations}

Occasionally, two populations will have standard deviations that are so similar that they can be treated as identical. For example, historical data or a well-understood biological mechanism may justify this strong assumption. In such cases, we can make our $t$ distribution approach slightly more precise by using a pooled standard deviation.

The \term{pooled standard deviation} of two groups is a way to use data from both samples to better estimate the standard deviation and standard error. If $s_1^{}$ and $s_2^{}$ are the standard deviations of groups 1 and 2 and there are good reasons to believe that the population standard deviations are equal, then we can obtain an improved estimate of the group variances by pooling their data:
\begin{align*}
s_{pooled}^2 = \frac{s_1^2\times (n_1-1) + s_2^2\times (n_2-1)}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}
\end{align*}
where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes, as before. To use this new statistic, we substitute $s_{pooled}^2$ in place of $s_1^2$ and $s_2^2$ in the standard error formula, and we use an updated formula for the degrees of freedom:
\begin{align*}
df = n_1 + n_2 - 2
\end{align*}

The benefits of pooling the standard deviation are realized through obtaining a better estimate of the standard deviation for each group and using a larger degrees of freedom parameter for the $t$ distribution. Both of these changes may permit a more accurate model of the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$.

\begin{caution}
{Pooling standard deviations should be done only after careful research}
{A pooled standard deviation is only appropriate when background research indicates the population standard deviations are nearly equal. When the sample size is large and the condition may be adequately checked with data, the benefits of pooling the standard deviations greatly diminishes.}
\end{caution}

\section[Comparing many means with ANOVA (special topic)]{Comparing many means with ANOVA\\(special topic)}
\label{anovaAndRegrWithCategoricalVariables}

\index{analysis of variance (ANOVA)|(}

Sometimes we want to compare means across many groups. We might initially think to do pairwise comparisons; for example, if there were three groups, we might be tempted to compare the first mean with the second, then with the third, and then finally compare the second and third means for a total of three comparisons. However, this strategy can be treacherous. If we have many groups and do many comparisons, it is likely that we will eventually find a difference just by chance, even if there is no difference in the populations.

In this section, we will learn a new method called \term{analysis of variance (ANOVA)} and a new test statistic called $F$. ANOVA uses a single hypothesis test to check whether the means across many groups are equal:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] The mean outcome is the same across all groups. In statistical notation, $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_k$ where $\mu_i$ represents the mean of the outcome for observations in category $i$.
\item[$H_A$:] At least one mean is different.
\end{itemize}
Generally we must check three conditions on the data before performing ANOVA:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item the observations are independent within and across groups,
\item the data within each group are nearly normal, and
\item the variability across the groups is about equal.
\end{itemize}
When these three conditions are met, we may perform an ANOVA to determine whether the data provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis that all the $\mu_i$ are equal.

\begin{example}{College departments commonly run multiple lectures of the same introductory course each semester because of high demand. Consider a statistics department that runs three lectures of an introductory statistics course. We might like to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in first exam scores in these three classes ($A$, $B$, and $C$). Describe appropriate hypotheses to determine whether there are any differences between the three classes.} \label{firstExampleForThreeStatisticsClassesAndANOVA}
The hypotheses may be written in the following form:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] The average score is identical in all lectures. Any observed difference is due to chance. Notationally, we write $\mu_A=\mu_B=\mu_C$.
\item[$H_A$:] The average score varies by class. We would reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis if there were larger differences among the class averages than what we might expect from chance alone.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

Strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis in ANOVA is described by unusually large differences among the group means. We will soon learn that assessing the variability of the group means relative to the variability among individual observations within each group is key to ANOVA's success.

\begin{example}{Examine Figure~\ref{toyANOVA}. Compare groups I, II, and III. Can you visually determine if the differences in the group centers is due to chance or not? Now compare groups IV, V, and VI. Do these differences appear to be due to chance?}

\caption{Side-by-side dot plot for the outcomes for six groups.\vspaceB{-3.5mm}}
\label{toyANOVA}
\end{figure}

Any real difference in the means of groups I, II, and III is difficult to discern, because the data within each group are very volatile relative to any differences in the average outcome. On the other hand, it appears there are differences in the centers of groups IV, V, and VI. For instance, group V appears to have a higher mean than that of the other two groups. Investigating groups IV, V, and VI, we see the differences in the groups' centers are noticeable because those differences are large \emph{relative to the variability in the individual observations within each group}.
\end{example}


\subsection{Is batting performance related to player position in MLB?}

\index{data!MLB batting|(}

We would like to discern whether there are real differences between the batting performance of baseball players according to their position: outfielder (\resp{OF}), infielder (\resp{IF}), designated hitter (\resp{DH}), and catcher (\resp{C}). We will use a data set called \data{bat10}, which includes batting records of 327 Major League Baseball (MLB) players from the 2010 season. Six of the 327 cases represented in \data{bat10} are shown in Table~\ref{mlbBat10DataMatrix}, and descriptions for each variable are provided in Table~\ref{mlbBat10Variables}. The measure we will use for the player batting performance (the outcome variable) is on-base percentage (\var{OBP}). The on-base percentage roughly represents the fraction of the time a player successfully gets on base or hits a home run.

Why might it be inappropriate to run the test by simply estimating whether the difference of $\mu_{\var{DH}}$ and $\mu_{\resp{C}}$ is statistically significant at a 0.05 significance level?}
\label{multipleComparisonExampleThatIncludesDiscussionOfClassrooms}
The primary issue here is that we are inspecting the data before picking the groups that will be compared. It is inappropriate to examine all data by eye (informal testing) and only afterwards decide which parts to formally test. This is called \term{data snooping} or \term{data fishing}. Naturally we would pick the groups with the large differences for the formal test, leading to an inflation in the Type 1 Error rate. To understand this better, let's consider a slightly different problem.

Suppose we are to measure the aptitude for students in 20 classes in a large elementary school at the beginning of the year. In this school, all students are randomly assigned to classrooms, so any differences we observe between the classes at the start of the year are completely due to chance. However, with so many groups, we will probably observe a few groups that look rather different from each other. If we select only these classes that look so different, we will probably make the wrong conclusion that the assignment wasn't random. While we might only formally test differences for a few pairs of classes, we informally evaluated the other classes by eye before choosing the most extreme cases for a comparison.
\end{example}

For additional information on the ideas expressed in Example~\ref{multipleComparisonExampleThatIncludesDiscussionOfClassrooms}, we recommend reading about the \term{prosecutor's fallacy}.\footnote{See, for example, \href{http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2007/05/the_prosecutors.html}{www.stat.columbia.edu/$\sim$cook/movabletype/archives/2007/05/the\_prosecutors.html}.}

In the next section we will learn how to use the $F$ statistic and ANOVA to test whether observed differences in means could have happened just by chance even if there was no difference in the respective population means.


\subsection{Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the F test}

The method of analysis of variance in this context focuses on answering one question: is the variability in the sample means so large that it seems unlikely to be from chance alone? This question is different from earlier testing procedures since we will \emph{simultaneously} consider many groups, and evaluate whether their sample means differ more than we would expect from natural variation. We call this variability the \term{mean square between groups ($MSG$)}, and it has an associated degrees of freedom, $df_{G}=k-1$ when there are $k$ groups. The $MSG$ can be thought of as a scaled variance formula for means. If the null hypothesis is true, any variation in the sample means is due to chance and shouldn't be too large. Details of $MSG$ calculations are provided in the footnote,\footnote{Let $\bar{x}$ represent the mean of outcomes across all groups. Then the mean square between groups is computed as
\begin{align*}
MSG = \frac{1}{df_{G}}SSG = \frac{1}{k-1}\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_{i}\left(\bar{x}_{i} - \bar{x}\right)^2
\end{align*}
where $SSG$ is called the \term{sum of squares between groups} and $n_{i}$ is the sample size of group $i$.} however, we typically use software for these computations.

The mean square between the groups is, on its own, quite useless in a hypothesis test. We need a benchmark value for how much variability should be expected among the sample means if the null hypothesis is true. To this end, we compute a pooled variance estimate, often abbreviated as the \term{mean square error ($MSE$)}, which has an associated degrees of freedom value $df_E=n-k$. It is helpful to think of $MSE$ as a measure of the variability within the groups. Details of the computations of the $MSE$ are provided in the footnote\footnote{Let $\bar{x}$ represent the mean of outcomes across all groups. Then the \term{sum of squares total ($SST$)} is computed as
\begin{align*}
SST = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_{i} - \bar{x}\right)^2
\end{align*}
where the sum is over all observations in the data set. Then we compute the \term{sum of squared errors ($SSE$)} in one of two equivalent ways:
\begin{align*}
SSE &= SST - SSG \\
	&= (n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2 + \cdots + (n_k-1)s_k^2
\end{align*}
where $s_i^2$ is the sample variance (square of the standard deviation) of the residuals in group $i$. Then the $MSE$ is the standardized form of $SSE$: $MSE = \frac{1}{df_{E}}SSE$.} for interested readers.

When the null hypothesis is true, any differences among the sample means are only due to chance, and the $MSG$ and $MSE$ should be about equal. As a test statistic for ANOVA, we examine the fraction of $MSG$ and $MSE$:
\begin{align} \label{formulaForTheFStatistic}
F = \frac{MSG}{MSE}
\end{align}
The $MSG$ represents a measure of the between-group variability, and $MSE$ measures the variability within each of the groups.

\begin{exercise}
For the baseball data, $MSG = 0.00252$ and $MSE=0.00127$. Identify the degrees of freedom associated with MSG and MSE and verify the $F$ statistic is approximately 1.994.\footnote{There are $k=4$ groups, so $df_{G} = k-1 = 3$. There are $n = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 = 327$ total observations, so $df_{E} = n - k = 323$. Then the $F$ statistic is computed as the ratio of $MSG$ and $MSE$: $F = \frac{MSG}{MSE} = \frac{0.00252}{0.00127} = 1.984 \approx 1.994$. ($F=1.994$ was computed by using values for $MSG$ and $MSE$ that were not rounded.)}

We can use the $F$ statistic to evaluate the hypotheses in what is called an \term{F test}. A p-value can be computed from the $F$ statistic using an $F$ distribution, which has two associated parameters: $df_{1}$ and $df_{2}$. For the $F$ statistic in ANOVA, $df_{1} = df_{G}$ and $df_{2}= df_{E}$. An $F$ distribution with 3 and 323 degrees of freedom, corresponding to the $F$ statistic for the baseball hypothesis test, is shown in Figure~\ref{fDist3And323}.

\caption{An $F$ distribution with $df_1=3$ and $df_2=323$.}
\label{fDist3And323}
\end{figure}

The larger the observed variability in the sample means ($MSG$) relative to the within-group observations ($MSE$), the larger $F$ will be and the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. Because larger values of $F$ represent stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, we use the upper tail of the distribution to compute a p-value.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{The $F$ statistic and the $F$ test}
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test whether the mean outcome differs across 2 or more groups. ANOVA uses a test statistic $F$, which represents a standardized ratio of variability in the sample means relative to the variability within the groups. If $H_0$ is true and the model assumptions are satisfied, the statistic $F$ follows an $F$ distribution with parameters $df_{1}=k-1$ and $df_{2}=n-k$. The upper tail of the $F$ distribution is used to represent the p-value.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise}\label{describePValueAreaForFDistributionInMLBOBPExample}
The test statistic for the baseball example is $F=1.994$. Shade the area corresponding to the p-value in Figure~\ref{fDist3And323}. \footnote{\ \vspace{-4mm}\\\includegraphics[height=20mm]{05/figures/fDist3And323/fDist3And323Shaded}}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{The p-value corresponding to the shaded area in the solution of Exercise~\ref{describePValueAreaForFDistributionInMLBOBPExample} is equal to about 0.115. Does this provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis?}
The p-value is larger than 0.05, indicating the evidence is not strong enough to reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05. That is, the data do not provide strong evidence that the average on-base percentage varies by player's primary field position.
\end{example}


\subsection{Reading an ANOVA table from software}

The calculations required to perform an ANOVA by hand are tedious and prone to human error. For these reasons, it is common to use statistical software to calculate the $F$ statistic and p-value.

An ANOVA can be summarized in a table very similar to that of a regression summary, which we will see in \MultipleRegressionChapter{Chapters~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar} and~\ref{multipleAndLogisticRegression}}{Chapter~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar}}. Table~\ref{anovaSummaryTableForOBPAgainstPosition} shows an ANOVA summary to test whether the mean of on-base percentage varies by player positions in the MLB. Many of these values should look familiar; in particular, the $F$ test statistic and p-value can be retrieved from the last columns.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
  \hline
 & Df & Sum Sq & Mean Sq & F value & Pr($>$F) \\ 
  \hline
position & 3 & 0.0076 & 0.0025 & 1.9943 & 0.1147 \\ 
  Residuals & 323 & 0.4080 & 0.0013 &  &  \\    \hline
\multicolumn{6}{r}{$s_{pooled} = 0.036$ on $df=323$}
\end{tabular}
\caption{ANOVA summary for testing whether the average on-base percentage differs across player positions.}
\label{anovaSummaryTableForOBPAgainstPosition}
\end{table}


\subsection{Graphical diagnostics for an ANOVA analysis}

There are three conditions we must check for an ANOVA analysis: all observations must be independent, the data in each group must be nearly normal, and the variance within each group must be approximately equal.

\begin{description}
\item[Independence.] If the data are a simple random sample from less than 10\% of the population, this condition is satisfied. For processes and experiments, carefully consider whether the data may be independent (e.g. no pairing). For example, in the MLB data, the data were not sampled. However, there are not obvious reasons why independence would not hold for most or all observations.
\item[Approximately normal.] As with one- and two-sample testing for means, the normality assumption is especially important when the sample size is quite small. The normal probability plots for each group of the MLB data are shown in Figure~\ref{mlbANOVADiagNormalityGroups}; there is some deviation from normality for infielders, but this isn't a substantial concern since there are about 150 observations in that group and the outliers are not extreme. Sometimes in ANOVA there are so many groups or so few observations per group that checking normality for each group isn't reasonable. See the footnote\footnote{First calculate the \termsub{residuals}{residual} of the baseball data, which are calculated by taking the observed values and subtracting the corresponding group means. For example, an outfielder with OBP of 0.435 would have a residual of $0.405 - \bar{x}_{OF} = 0.071$. Then to check the normality condition, create a normal probability plot using all the residuals simultaneously.} for guidance on how to handle such instances.

\begin{figure}[hhh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{05/figures/mlbANOVA/mlbANOVADiagNormalityGroups}
\caption{Normal probability plot of OBP for each field position.}
\label{mlbANOVADiagNormalityGroups}
\end{figure}

\item[Constant variance.] The last assumption is that the variance in the groups is about equal from one group to the next. This assumption can be checked by examining a side-by-side box plot of the outcomes across the groups, as in Figure~\vref{mlbANOVABoxPlot}. In this case, the variability is similar in the four groups but not identical. We see in Table~\vref{mlbHRPerABSummaryTable} that the standard deviation varies a bit from one group to the next. Whether these differences are from natural variation is unclear, so we should report this uncertainty with the final results.

\begin{caution}
{Diagnostics for an ANOVA analysis}
{Independence is always important to an ANOVA analysis. The normality condition is very important when the sample sizes for each group are relatively small. The constant variance condition is especially important when the sample sizes differ between groups.}
\end{caution}


\subsection{Multiple comparisons and controlling Type 1 Error rate}
\label{multipleComparisonsAndControllingTheType1ErrorRate}

\index{significance level!multiple comparisons|(}

When we reject the null hypothesis in an ANOVA analysis, we might wonder, which of these groups have different means? To answer this question, we compare the means of each possible pair of groups. For instance, if there are three groups and there is strong evidence that there are some differences in the group means, there are three comparisons to make: group 1 to group 2, group 1 to group 3, and group 2 to group 3. These comparisons can be accomplished using a two-sample $t$ test, but we use a modified significance level and a pooled estimate of the standard deviation across groups. Usually this pooled standard deviation can be found in the ANOVA table, e.g. along the bottom of Table~\ref{anovaSummaryTableForOBPAgainstPosition}.

\textB{\newpage}

\begin{example}{Example~\vref{firstExampleForThreeStatisticsClassesAndANOVA} discussed three statistics lectures, all taught during the same semester. Table~\ref{summaryStatisticsForClassTestData} shows summary statistics for these three courses, and a side-by-side box plot of the data is shown in Figure~\ref{classDataSBSBoxPlot}. We would like to conduct an ANOVA for these data. Do you see any deviations from the three conditions for ANOVA?}
In this case (like many others) it is difficult to check independence in a rigorous way. Instead, the best we can do is use common sense to consider reasons the assumption of independence may not hold. For instance, the independence assumption may not be reasonable if there is a star teaching assistant that only half of the students may access; such a scenario would divide a class into two subgroups. No such situations were evident for these particular data, and we believe that independence is acceptable.

The distributions in the side-by-side box plot appear to be roughly symmetric and show no noticeable outliers.

The box plots show approximately equal variability, which can be verified in Table~\ref{summaryStatisticsForClassTestData}, supporting the constant variance assumption.

\begin{exercise} \label{exerExaminingAnovaSummaryTableForMidtermData}
An ANOVA was conducted for the midterm data, and summary results are shown in Table~\ref{anovaSummaryTableForMidtermData}. What should we conclude?\footnote{The p-value of the test is 0.0330, less than the default significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in the average midterm scores are not due to chance.}
\end{exercise}

\label{anovaSummaryTableForMidtermData}
\end{table}

There is strong evidence that the different means in each of the three classes is not simply due to chance. We might wonder, which of the classes are actually different? As discussed in earlier chapters, a two-sample $t$ test could be used to test for differences in each possible pair of groups. However, one pitfall was discussed in Example~\vref{multipleComparisonExampleThatIncludesDiscussionOfClassrooms}: when we run so many tests, the Type~1 Error rate increases. This issue is resolved by using a modified significance level. \vspaceB{-1mm}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Multiple comparisons and the Bonferroni correction for $\alpha$}
The scenario of testing many pairs of groups is called \term{multiple comparisons}. The \term{Bonferroni correction} suggests that a more stringent significance level is more appropriate for these tests:
\begin{align*}
\alpha^* = \alpha / K
\end{align*}
where $K$ is the number of comparisons being considered (formally or informally). If there are $k$ groups, then usually all possible pairs are compared and $K=\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{example}{In Exercise~\ref{exerExaminingAnovaSummaryTableForMidtermData}, you found strong evidence of differences in the average midterm grades between the three lectures. Complete the three possible pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni correction and report any differences.} \label{multipleComparisonsOfThreeStatClasses}
We use a modified significance level of $\alpha^* = 0.05/3 = 0.0167$. Additionally, we use the pooled estimate of the standard deviation: $s_{pooled}=13.61$ on $df=161$, which is provided in the ANOVA summary table.

Lecture A versus Lecture B: The estimated difference and standard error are, respectively,
\begin{align*}
\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_{B} &= 75.1 - 72 = 3.1
	&SE = \sqrt{\frac{13.61^2}{58} + \frac{13.61^2}{55}} &= 2.56
\end{align*}
(See Section~\vref{pooledStandardDeviations} for additional details.) This results in a $T$ score of 1.21 on $df = 161$ (we use the $df$ associated with $s_{pooled}$). Statistical software was used to precisely identify the two-tailed p-value since the modified significance of 0.0167 is not found in the $t$ table. The p-value (0.228) is larger than $\alpha^*=0.0167$, so there is not strong evidence of a difference in the means of lectures A and B.

Lecture A versus Lecture C: The estimated difference and standard error are 3.8 and 2.61, respectively. This results in a $T$ score of 1.46 on $df = 161$ and a two-tailed p-value of 0.1462. This p-value is larger than $\alpha^*$, so there is not strong evidence of a difference in the means of lectures A and C.

Lecture B versus Lecture C: The estimated difference and standard error are 6.9 and 2.65, respectively. This results in a $T$ score of 2.60 on $df = 161$ and a two-tailed p-value of 0.0102. This p-value is smaller than $\alpha^*$. Here we find strong evidence of a difference in the means of lectures B and C.
\end{example}

We might summarize the findings of the analysis from Example~\ref{multipleComparisonsOfThreeStatClasses} using the following notation:
\begin{align*}
\mu_A &\stackrel{?}{=} \mu_B
	&\mu_A &\stackrel{?}{=} \mu_C
	&\mu_B &\neq \mu_C
\end{align*}
The midterm mean in lecture A is not statistically distinguishable from those of lectures B or C. However, there is strong evidence that lectures B and C are different. In the first two pairwise comparisons, we did not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Recall that failing to reject $H_0$ does not imply $H_0$ is true.

\begin{caution}
{Sometimes an ANOVA will reject the null but no groups will have statistically significant differences}
{It is possible to reject the null hypothesis using ANOVA and then to not subsequently identify differences in the pairwise comparisons. However, \emph{this does not invalidate the ANOVA conclusion}. It only means we have not been able to successfully identify which groups differ in their means.}
\end{caution}

The ANOVA procedure examines the big picture: it considers all groups simultaneously to decipher whether there is evidence that some difference exists. Even if the test indicates that there is strong evidence of differences in group means, identifying with high confidence a specific difference as statistically significant is more difficult.

Consider the following analogy: we observe a Wall Street firm that makes large quantities of money based on predicting mergers. Mergers are generally difficult to predict, and if the prediction success rate is extremely high, that may be considered sufficiently strong evidence to warrant investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the SEC may be quite certain that there is insider trading taking place at the firm, the evidence against any single trader may not be very strong. It is only when the SEC considers all the data that they identify the pattern. This is effectively the strategy of ANOVA: stand back and consider all the groups simultaneously.
